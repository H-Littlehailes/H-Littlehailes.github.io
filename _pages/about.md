Physicist, researcher, nanofabrication engineer, and data analyst based in London. My interests include next generation material and technology for advanced technology, and the implementation of machine learning for analysing big-data.​

I graduated from my bachelors in Physics with Astrophysics from the University of Glasgow in 2017, with final research projects investigating the optical losses of silicon nitride membranes for gravitational wave detection, using a 1550 nm laser in a Fabry-Perot cavity, and the automation of an observatory telescope dome with an arduino microcontroller.​

After graduation I joined the centre for doctoral training in photonic integration and advanced data storage (CDT PIADS) in 2013, split between Queen’s University Belfast (QUB) and the University of Glasgow (UoG). ​This was an integrated masters / PhD course with the first two semesters split between the two sites, with advanced training in photonic, plasmonic, and semiconductor physics, waveguide and integrated photonic devices, and materials science and nanofabrication. This was coupled with research projects on the measurement and characterisation of femtosecond pulses at UoG,  and the investigation of the efficacy of pulsed-DC vs continuous-DC magnetron sputtering of plasmonic thin films of TiN. After this, I specialised for the substantial PhD project, investigating alternative candidate refractory plasmonic alloys and alternative near-field transducer geometries for application in next photonic heat assisted magnetic recording hard-drives. For this I arranged to split my PhD time between both research institutions to make the most of this unique opportunity and the research specialisms and fabrication facilities.​

In 2022 I joined Seagate technology as a senior process engineer / thin-film scientist​, responsible for magnetron sputter deposition and ion-beam etch processes for existing products, as well as the trialling and integration of processes and components for next generation hard-drive technology.
