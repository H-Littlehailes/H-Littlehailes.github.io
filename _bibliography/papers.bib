   abstract = {Extremely intense and ultrafast X-ray pulses from free-electron lasers offer unique opportunities to study fundamental aspects of complex transient phenomena in materials. Ultrafast time-resolved methods usually require highly synchronized pulses to initiate a transition and then probe it after a precisely defined time delay. In the X-ray regime, these methods are challenging because they require complex optical systems and diagnostics. Here we propose and apply a simple holographic measurement scheme, inspired by Newton's 'dusty mirror' experiment, to monitor the X-ray-induced explosion of microscopic objects. The sample is placed near an X-ray mirror; after the pulse traverses the sample, triggering the reaction, it is reflected back onto the sample by the mirror to probe this reaction. The delay is encoded in the resulting diffraction pattern to an accuracy of one femtosecond, and the structural change is holographically recorded with high resolution. We apply the technique to monitor the dynamics of polystyrene spheres in intense free-electron-laser pulses, and observe an explosion occurring well after the initial pulse. Our results support the notion that X-ray flash imaging can be used to achieve high resolution, beyond radiation damage limits for biological samples. With upcoming ultrafast X-ray sources we will be able to explore the three-dimensional dynamics of materials at the timescale of atomic motion.},

It involves capturing a large digital hologram containing multiple smaller holograms, each of which characterizes the spatial intensity and phase distributions of an individual frequency component of the pulse. From that single camera frame, we numerically reconstruct the complete electric field, E(x,y,t), using a direct algorithm. While holography requires a well-characterized reference pulse, this pulse can easily be generated from the pulse itself in most cases, so the technique is self-referencing. We experimentally demonstrate this technique using femtosecond pulses from a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire oscillator.},

   abstract = {We introduce a new technique, which we call frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG), for characterizing and displaying arbitrary femtosecond pulses. The method is simple, general, broad-band, and does not require a reference pulse. Using virtually any instantaneous nonlinear-optical effect, FROG involves measuring the spectrum of the signal pulse as a function of the delay between two input pulses. The resulting trace of intensity versus frequency and delay is related to the pulse's spectrogram, a visually intuitive transform containing both time and frequency information. We prove, using phase retrieval concepts, that the FROG trace yields the full intensity I(t) and phase phi(t) of an arbitrary ultrashort pulse with no physically significant ambiguities. We argue, in analogy with acoustics problems, that the FROG trace is in many ways as useful a representation of the pulse as the field itself. FROG appears to have temporal resolution limited only by the response of the nonlinear medium. We demonstrate the method using self-diffraction via the electronic Kerr effect in BK-7 glass and few muJ, 620 nm, linearly chirped, approximately 200 fs pulses.},

Consequently, THz waves have been extensively used to probe such responses with high sensitivity. However, owing to recent developments in high-power sources, scientists have started to abandon the role of pure observers and are now exploiting intense THz radiation to engineer transient states of matter. This Review provides an overview and illustrative examples of how the electric and magnetic fields of intense THz transients can be used to control matter and light resonantly and nonresonantly.},

We compare fluorescence excited in Styryl-9M molecules by femtosecond pulses at near IR wavelengths, where Styryl-9M shows the largest dependence of the two-photon absorption (2PA) cross section on the local environment. We show that by calculating the normalized ratio of the two-photon excited fluorescence (2PEF) intensity at 1200 nm and 1100 nm excitation wavelengths we can achieve high sensitivity and specificity for determining the location of cancer cells surrounded by normal cells. The 2PEF results showed a positive correlation with the levels of MDR1 proteins expressed by the cells, and, for high MDR1 expressors, as few as ten cancer cells could be detected. Similar high sensitivity is also demonstrated for tumor colonies induced in mouse external ears. This technique could be useful in early cancer detection, and, perhaps, also in monitoring dormant cancer deposits.},

   abstract = {In the field of magnetron sputtering, it is well established that mid-frequency (20-350 kHz) pulsed processing offers many advantages over continuous DC processing for the reactive deposition of dielectric films. By periodically reversing the target voltage, arc events at the target are suppressed and the reactive sputtering process is stabilised. However, recent studies have shown that pulsing the discharge also significantly modifies the characteristics of the magnetron plasma. Specifically, increased plasma density and electron temperatures, and therefore increased ion energy fluxes to the growing film, have been measured. Clearly, this will have an impact on the properties of both insulating and conductive films. In this study, therefore, titanium dioxide and titanium nitride coatings were deposited by pulsed (asymmetric bipolar, 20-kHz pulse frequency) and continuous DC reactive sputtering. The coatings were characterised in terms of their structures and properties using a range of analytical and measurement techniques, including scanning electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, X-ray diffraction, micro-hardness testing, scratch adhesion testing, wear testing and surface profilometry. The optical properties of the TiO2films were also investigated. In this case, the pulsed films showed increased refractive index and peak transmission values in comparison to the DC films, while the tribological properties of both coating types were superior when pulsed processing was used in comparison with continuous processing. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

A comparative study of various materials including metals, metal alloys and heavily doped semiconductors is presented. The performance of each material is evaluated based on quality factors defined for each class of plasmonic devices. Most importantly, this paper outlines an approach for realizing optimal plasmonic material properties for specific frequencies and applications, thereby providing a reference for those searching for better plasmonic materials.},

   abstract = {High-quality materials are critical for advances in plasmonics, especially as researchers now investigate quantum effects at the limit of single surface plasmons or exploit ultraviolet- or CMOS-compatible metals such as aluminum or copper. Unfortunately, due to inexperience with deposition methods, many plasmonics researchers deposit metals under the wrong conditions, severely limiting perform- ance unnecessarily. This is then compounded as others follow their published procedures. In this perspective, we describe simple rules collected from the surface-science literature that allow high-quality plasmonic films of aluminum, copper, gold, and silver to be easily deposited with commonly available equipment (a thermal evaporator). Recipes are also provided so that films with optimal optical properties can be routinely obtained.},

   abstract = {Heat-assisted magnetic recording is a promising approach for enabling large increases in the storage density of hard disk drives. A laser is used to momentarily heat the recording area of the medium to reduce its coercivity below that of the applied magnetic field from the recording head. In such a system, the recording materials have a very high magnetic anisotropy, which is essential for the thermal stability of the magnetization of the extremely small grains in the medium. This technology involves new recording physics, new approaches to near field optics, a recording head that integrates optics and magnetics, new recording materials, lubricants that can withstand extremely high temperatures, and new approaches to the recording channel design. This paper surveys the challenges for this technology and the progress that has been made in addressing them.},

   abstract = {Materials such as W, TiN, and SrRuO3 (SRO) have been suggested as promising alternatives to Au and Ag in plasmonic applications owing to their stability at high operational temperatures. However, investigation of the reproducibility of the optical properties after thermal cycling between room and elevated temperatures is so far lacking. Here, thin films of W, Mo, Ti, TiN, TiON, Ag, Au, SrRuO3 and SrNbO3 are investigated to assess their viability for robust refractory plasmonic applications. These results are further compared to the performance of SrMoO3 reported in literature. Films ranging in thickness from 50 to 105 nm are deposited on MgO, SrTiO3 and Si substrates by e-beam evaporation, RF magnetron sputtering and pulsed laser deposition, prior to characterisation by means of AFM, XRD, spectroscopic ellipsometry, and DC resistivity. Measurements are conducted before and after annealing in air at temperatures ranging from 300 to 1000&#x00B0; C for one hour, to establish the maximum cycling temperature and potential longevity at elevated temperatures for each material. It is found that SrRuO3 retains metallic behaviour after annealing at 800&#x00B0; C, while SrNbO3 undergoes a phase transition resulting in a loss of metallic behaviour after annealing at 400&#x00B0; C. Importantly, the optical properties of TiN and TiON are degraded as a result of oxidation and show a loss of metallic behaviour after annealing at 500&#x00B0; C, while the same is not observed in Au until annealing at 600&#x00B0; C. Nevertheless, both TiN and TiON may be better suited than Au or SRO for high temperature applications operating under vacuum conditions.},

   abstract = {The high-pressure, high-temperature behavior of iron has been investigated to 161 GPa and 3000 K by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction with double-side laser-heated diamond anvil cells. We found that only α-, γ- and ε-Fe can be clearly verified as the stable solid phase in the P - T range studied. Only ε-Fe is observed from deep lower mantle (∼1500 km) to outer core conditions. Within the P - T range examined, we did not observe a significant change with pressure or temperature on the c / a ratio of ε-Fe. The melting curve of iron has been determined to 105 GPa. A Lindeman law fit gives a melting point of iron at the inner core boundary of 5800 (±200) K, which provides an upper bound on the temperature at that depth. We also examine numerous experimental factors that may complicate the analysis of high P - T diffraction data, and discuss the effects of sample stress on the X-ray diffraction results. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This paper reviews some of the recent advances in recording media (e.g. oriented and antiferromagnetically coupled media) that have helped magnetic recording to maintain the areal density growth rate. However, more innovations and novel architectures are needed for the solutions of tomorrow. Among the more promising media approaches, which are discussed in this paper, are perpendicular, patterned and self-assembled nanoparticle media. Additionally, thermally assisted recording is also reviewed as it combines good writeability with high thermal stability.},

   abstract = {A surface plasmon (SP) is a fundamental excitation state that exists in metal nanostructures. Over the past several years, the performance of optoelectronic devices has been improved greatly via the SP enhancement effect. In our previous work, the responsivity of GaN ultraviolet detectors was increased by over 30 times when using Ag nanoparticles. However, the physics of the SP enhancement effect has not been established definitely because of the lack of experimental evidence. To reveal the physical origin of this enhancement, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was used to observe the SP-induced surface potential reduction in the vicinity of Ag nanoparticles on a GaN epilayer. Under ultraviolet illumination, the localized field enhancement induced by the SP forces the photogenerated electrons to drift close to the Ag nanoparticles, leading to a reduction of the surface potential around the Ag nanoparticles on the GaN epilayer. For an isolated Ag nanoparticle with a diameter of ~ 200 nm, the distribution of the SP localized field is located within 60 nm of the boundary of the Ag nanoparticle. For a dimer of Ag nanoparticles, the localized field enhancement between the nanoparticles was the strongest. The results presented here provide direct experimental proof of the localized field enhancement. These results not only explain the high performance of GaN detectors observed with the use of Ag nanoparticles but also reveal the physical mechanism of SP enhancement in optoelectronic devices, which will help us further understand and improve the performance of SP-based optoelectronic devices in the future.},

In this work the temperature-induced changes of a tetracrystalline model system with inhibited surface diffusion are studied. This is accomplished by growing Al thin films by molecular beam epitaxy on single crystalline (0001) oriented sapphire substrates. The as-deposited Al films form two orientation relationships (OR I and OR II) both subdivided in two twin-related growth variants leading to a tetracrystalline microstructure. Two processes evolve during annealing at 600 °C. Grain growth and texture evolution towards OR II occur in addition to the formation of drum-like voids in the Al film covered by a thin membrane. The surface oxide suppresses Al surface diffusion and in contrast to classical solid state dewetting interface and grain boundary diffusion dominate. High energy grain boundaries were identified as initial points of the void formation.},

Even after separating the probe from the surface, the value was still displayed on the screen and could be read easily.

Density functional theory combined with the random phase approximation is used to calculate the dielectric functions for these compounds. The aim of this work is to investigate how the band edge and plasma frequency vary with composition in order to identify materials with promising plasmonic properties. Towards this end the intermetallic compounds chosen are composed of elements which on their own have reasonable optical properties for plasmonic applications. The position of the band edge relative to the plasma frequency is most favourable in the simple binary compounds formed from the alkali plus noble metals NaAu, KAu and KAg. In particular, for KAu the band edge and plasma frequency occur at almost the same frequency, and hence the imaginary part of the dielectric function is practically zero for frequencies below the plasma frequency. In addition, the plasma frequency in this compound is at relatively low frequency, promising a material with strong plasmon response in the infrared. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The basis functions and the electron density are projected on a real-space grid, in order to calculate the Hartree and exchange-correlation potentials and matrix elements, with a number of operations that scales linearly with the size of the system. We use a modified energy functional, whose minimization produces orthogonal wavefunctions and the same energy and density as the Kohn-Sham energy functional, without the need for an explicit orthogonalization. Additionally, using localized Wannier-like electron wavefunctions allows the computation time and memory required to minimize the energy to also scale linearly with the size of the system. Forces and stresses are also calculated efficiently and accurately, thus allowing structural relaxation and molecular dynamics simulations.},

At 112 sccm O 2 the synthesis of Ag2O is reached. At higher flow, a semi transparent coating was formed, which is assumed to be AgO. The dispersions for synthesized single AgO fit the resulting oxide layer, grown by a subsequent oxygen rich plasma process, very well. The modeling of plasma oxidation of silver showed, that the formation of the AgO phase is not the only reason for the degradation of silver containing layer stacks.

Similar to the way silicon revolutionized the microelectronics industry, the proper materials can greatly impact the field of plasmonics and metamaterials. Currently, research in plasmonics and metamaterials lacks good material building blocks in order to realize useful devices. Such devices suffer from many drawbacks arising from the undesirable properties of their material building blocks, especially metals. There are many materials, other than conventional metallic components such as gold and silver, that exhibit metallic properties and provide advantages in device performance, design flexibility, fabrication, integration, and tunability. This review explores different material classes for plasmonic and metamaterial applications, such as conventional semiconductors, transparent conducting oxides, perovskite oxides, metal nitrides, silicides, germanides, and 2D materials such as graphene. This review provides a summary of the recent developments in the search for better plasmonic materials and an outlook of further research directions. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

   abstract = {Transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) are emerging as possible alternative constituent materials to replace noble metals such as silver and gold for low-loss plasmonic and metamaterial (MM) applications in the near infrared regime (NIR). The optical characteristics of TCOs have been studied to evaluate the functionalities and potential of these materials as metal substitutes in plasmonic and MM devices, even apart from their usual use as electrode materials. However, patterning TCOs at the nanoscale, which is necessary for plasmonic and MM devices, is not well studied. This paper investigates nanopatterning processes for TCOs, especially the liftoff technique with electron-beam lithography, and the realization of plasmonic nanostructures with TCOs. By employing the developed nanopatterning process, we fabricate 2-D-periodic arrays of TCO nanodisks and characterize the material's plasmonic properties to evaluate the performance of TCOs as metal substitutes. Light-induced collective oscillations of the free electrons in the TCOs (bulk plasmons) and localized surface plasmon resonances are observed in the wavelength range from 1.6 to 2.1 μm. Well-defined resonance peaks are observed, which can be dramatically tuned by varying the amount of dopant and by thermally annealing the TCO nanodisks in nitrogen gas ambient while maintaining the low-loss properties. © 1995-2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {© 2017 Optical Society of America. We report a comprehensive experimental study of optical and electrical properties of thin polycrystalline gold films in a wide range of film thicknesses (from 20 to 200 nm). Our experimental results are supported by theoretical calculations based on the measured morphology of the fabricated gold films. We demonstrate that the dielectric function of the metal is determined by its structural morphology. Although the fabrication process can be absolutely the same for different films, the dielectric function can strongly depend on the film thickness. Our studies show that the imaginary part of the dielectric function of gold, which is responsible for optical losses, rapidly increases as the film thickness decreases for thicknesses below 80 nm. At the same time, we do not observe a noticeable dependence of optical constants on the film thickness for thicker samples. These findings establish design rules for thin-film plasmonic and nanophotonic devices.},

The intrinsic or bulk resistivity is obtained by solving a Boltzmann equation in which both grain-boundary and background scattering are accounted for. The total resistivity is obtained by imposing boundary conditions due to the external surfaces (as in the Fuchs theory) on this Boltzmann equation. Interpretation of published data on grain-boundary scattering in bulk materials in terms of the calculated intrinsic resistivity, and of thin-film data in terms of the calculated total resistivity suggests that (i) the grain-boundary reflection coefficient in Al is ≈ 0.15, while it is somewhat higher in Cu; (ii) the observed thickness dependence of the resistivity in thin films is due to grain-boundary scattering as well as to the Fuchs size effect; and (iii) the common observation that single-crystal films possess lower resistivities than polycrystalline films may be accounted for by grain-boundary effects rather than by differences in the nature of surface scattering.},

The efficiency of plasmonic and optical metamaterial devices depends on the geometry and optical properties of the constituent materials. Usually, geometry optimization is performed to design efficient devices and obtain the required functionality. However, tailoring and adjusting properties of the constituent materials is another dimension that can enhance the performance, provide design flexibility, and allow new physics to be explored with these devices. This chapter starts with a short discussion of the optical properties of materials, and then describes the major drawbacks of conventional metals currently used in plasmonics. This is followed by the discussion of various alternative plasmonic materials. Because the material platform is critical for the realization of practical plasmonic and metamaterial devices, an exploration of the capabilities and advantages of the proposed new plasmonic materials as well as novel device concepts with alternative materials are described. To estimate and evaluate the performance of alternative materials, a brief overview of the comparative studies of materials for various plasmonic and metamaterial applications is also provided.},

   abstract = {Beer's law assumes a linear dependence of absorbance on concentration, accordingly the index of absorption and the molar attenuation coefficient are material properties and the absorption cross section, including absorbance itself, must be additive if chemical interactions are excluded. Under the "no interaction" condition, a linear dependence should also exist between macroscopic polarization and the number of induced dipole moments per unit volume. The latter linear dependence is the basis for dispersion theory. Invoking Maxwell's wave equation, Beer's law has been derived recently from dispersion theory. As a result, Beer's law is a limiting law. Accordingly, indices of absorption and molar attenuation coefficients including absorption cross sections are no material properties and the latter can per se not be additive. Indeed, as we show in this contribution, not even for particles very small compared to wavelength, where the scattering cross sections can be neglected, is this additivity a given, except for comparably large distances between the particles. We investigate the magnitude of these critical distances with the help of finite difference time domain calculations for amorphous SiO 2 spheres in the infrared spectral range. Based on electric field maps, we conclude that the deviations scale with oscillator strengths and, correspondingly, with local electric fields and nearfield effects.},

Those properties have been used in the new technique of heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) to overcome an existing limit of conventional magnetic recording by utilizing a near-field transducer (NFT). The NFT designs are based on excitation of surface plasmons on a metal structure, which re-radiate with a subdiffraction limited light spot confined in the near field. In this paper, we propose a novel "droplet"-shaped NFT, which takes full advantage of a recenltly proposed Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI), a coupling arrangement that allows optimal coupling of light to the transducer. The droplet design ensures better impedance match with the recording media and, consequently, better coupling of power. The droplet design results in very high enhancement of the electric field and allows the confinement of light in a spot size much smaller than the present stateof- the-art lollipop transducer.},

Materials such as W, TiN, and SrRuO3(SRO) have been suggested as promising alternatives to Au and Ag in plasmonic applications owing to their stability at high operational temperatures. However, investigation of the reproducibility of the optical properties after thermal cycling between room and elevated temperatures is so far lacking. Here, thin films of W, Mo, Ti, TiN, TiON, Ag, Au, SrRuO3and SrNbO3are investigated to assess their viability for robust refractory plasmonic applications. These results are further compared to the performance of SrMoO3reported in literature. Films ranging in thickness from 50 to 105 nm are deposited on MgO, SrTiO3and Si substrates by e-beam evaporation, RF magnetron sputtering and pulsed laser deposition, prior to characterisation by means of AFM, XRD, spectroscopic ellipsometry, and DC resistivity. Measurements are conducted before and after annealing in air at temperatures ranging from 300 to 1000° C for one hour, to establish the maximum cycling temperature and potential longevity at elevated temperatures for each material. It is found that SrRuO3retains metallic behaviour after annealing at 800° C, while SrNbO3undergoes a phase transition resulting in a loss of metallic behaviour after annealing at 400° C. Importantly, the optical properties of TiN and TiON are degraded as a result of oxidation and show a loss of metallic behaviour after annealing at 500° C, while the same is not observed in Au until annealing at 600° C. Nevertheless, both TiN and TiON may be better suited than Au or SRO for high temperature applications operating under vacuum conditions.},

However, plasmonic nanostructures exposed to elevated temperature often experience permanent deformations, which could significantly degrade performance of the plasmonic devices. Therefore, understanding of thermal deformation of plasmonic nanostructures and its influence on the device performance is essential to the development of robust high-performance plasmonic devices. Here, we report thermal deformation of lithographic planar gold nanopatch and nanohole arrays and its influence on surface plasmon resonance sensing. The gold nanostructures are fabricated on a silicon substrate and on the end-face of an optical fiber using electron-beam lithography and focused-ion-beam lithography, respectively. The fabricated gold nanostructures are exposed to cyclic thermal loading in the range of 25 °C to 500 °C. Through experimental and numerical studies, we investigate (i) thermal deformation modes of the gold nanostructures, (ii) influence of the gold nanostructure geometry on the degree and mechanism of the thermal deformation, and (iii) influence of the thermal deformation on performance of surface plasmon resonance sensing. The obtained understanding from these studies is expected to help guide the development of robust high-performance plasmonic sensors for monitoring in elevated temperature environments. Although the current work is focused on gold nanostructures, it can be extended to provide useful insights on thermal deformation of refractory plasmonic nanostructures at extreme temperature.},

   abstract = {For nearly two decades, researchers in the field of plasmonics 1 - which studies the coupling of electromagnetic waves to the motion of free electrons near the surface of a metal 2 - have sought to realize subwavelength optical devices for information technology 3-6, sensing 7,8, nonlinear optics 9,10, optical nanotweezers 11 and biomedical applications 12 . However, the electron motion generates heat through ohmic losses. Although this heat is desirable for some applications such as photo-thermal therapy, it is a disadvantage in plasmonic devices for sensing and information technology 13 and has led to a widespread view that plasmonics is too lossy to be practical. Here we demonstrate that the ohmic losses can be bypassed by using 'resonant switching'. In the proposed approach, light is coupled to the lossy surface plasmon polaritons only in the device's off state (in resonance) in which attenuation is desired, to ensure large extinction ratios between the on and off states and allow subpicosecond switching. In the on state (out of resonance), destructive interference prevents the light from coupling to the lossy plasmonic section of a device. To validate the approach, we fabricated a plasmonic electro-optic ring modulator. The experiments confirm that low on-chip optical losses, operation at over 100 gigahertz, good energy efficiency, low thermal drift and a compact footprint can be combined in a single device. Our result illustrates that plasmonics has the potential to enable fast, compact on-chip sensing and communications technologies.},

   abstract = {Plasmonics enables the manipulation of light beyond the optical diffraction limit1–4 and may therefore confer advantages in applications such as photonic devices5–7, optical cloaking8,9, biochemical sensing10,11 and super-resolution imaging12,13. However, the essential field-confinement capability of plasmonic devices is always accompanied by a parasitic Ohmic loss, which severely reduces their performance. Therefore, plasmonic materials (those with collective oscillations of electrons) with a lower loss than noble metals have long been sought14–16. Here we present stable sodium-based plasmonic devices with state-of-the-art performance at near-infrared wavelengths. We fabricated high-quality sodium films with electron relaxation times as long as 0.42 picoseconds using a thermo-assisted spin-coating process. A direct-waveguide experiment shows that the propagation length of surface plasmon polaritons supported at the sodium–quartz interface can reach 200 micrometres at near-infrared wavelengths. We further demonstrate a room-temperature sodium-based plasmonic nanolaser with a lasing threshold of 140 kilowatts per square centimetre, lower than values previously reported for plasmonic nanolasers at near-infrared wavelengths. These sodium-based plasmonic devices show stable performance under ambient conditions over a period of several months after packaging with epoxy. These results indicate that the performance of plasmonic devices can be greatly improved beyond that of devices using noble metals, with implications for applications in plasmonics, nanophotonics and metamaterials.},

An analysis of published results using one of these methods suggests that the observed effects can be attributed to simultaneous small particle size and strain broadening. Measurements of the changes in intensity distribution have been made, using a Geiger counter spectrometer, in the spectra of cold worked aluminium and wolfram. The line breadths may be attributed to simultaneous small particle size and strain broadening, the latter predominating, particularly at the higher Bragg angles, and it is shown that the observed effects are produced by dislocations or some similar structural fault. The observed rise in the breadths of the high angle lines from annealed materials suggests that some dislocations remain after annealing. Fourier analysis of the line shapes in general merely confirm the results of the analysis of the line breadths, but in the case of the recovered specimens it suggests that the dislocations form into walls ("polygonization"). © 1953.},

   abstract = {Gold nanorods (Au NRs) are known for their efficient conversion of photon energy into heat, resulting in hyperthermia and suppression of tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Au NRs are thus of great promise for photothermal therapy (PTT) of different cancers. From the point of cancer therapy, low laser powers are essential (≤1 W cm-2) to ensure minimal side effects such as skin burning. Herein, we investigate the potential of polyethylene glycol functionalized reduced graphene oxide (rGO-PEG) enrobed Au NRs for the photothermal destruction of human glioblastoma astrocytoma (U87MG) cells in mice. We show that Au NRs@rGO-PEG are ideal multifunctional theranostic nanostructures that can exert efficient photothermal destruction of tumors in mice upon low doses of NIR light excitation and can act as fluorescent cellular markers due to the presence of a NIR dye integrated onto the rGO shell. Due to the specific interaction between Tat protein modified Au NRs@rGO-PEG nanostructures with the human glioblastoma astrocytoma (U87MG) cells, selective targeting of the tumor is achieved. In vivo experiments in mice show that upon irradiation of the tumor implanted in mice at 800 nm under low doses (0.7 W cm-2), U87MG tumor growth gets suppressed. The study demonstrates that the novel nanomaterials allow for an efficient destruction of solid tumors and might thus serve as an excellent multi-functional theranostic agent in photothermal therapeutic applications.},

The films' properties can be tailored by varying the energy of bombarding ions during sputter deposition and the substrate temperature (Td). The best metallic behavior of TiNx (resistivity 40 μΩcm and conduction density 5.5 × 1022 electrons/cm3) has been observed in films developed with energy above 100 eV and Td≥400°C. A redshift of the optical gaps has been observed for overstoichiometric films, suggesting it as a sensitive probe to investigate the TiNx stoichiometry. The energy, strength, and broadening of the interband transitions were studied with respect to the energy of ions and Td and they were explicitly correlated with the TiNx crystal cell size and grain orientation. On the other hand, the study of intraband absorption has provided the conduction electron density with respect to ion energy and Td, which promotes the densification of TiNx films due to different mechanisms. Combined SE and x-ray analysis was used to identify the electron scattering mechanisms, showing that the main electron scattering sites are the grain boundaries and the Ti vacancies for stoichiometric (x=1) and overstoichiometric (x∼1.1) films, respectively. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

This has been accomplished by using photosensitive-layered titanates, which can be densified and stiffened by UV irradiation. Au nanorods dispersed in titanate films were deposited by spin coating and treated by both UV irradiation and thermal annealing at different temperatures. By properly combining UV curing and thermal annealing, this method allows to obtain Au nanorods covered by crystalline TiO2 rigid shells and to retain their shape and peculiar optical properties.

All three compounds have very common features in their density of states, especially near the Fermi level: Co 3d -dominated characteristics with very small amounts of Co and Si sp characteristics. Consequently, the features observed in the optical conductivity (OC) spectra of 0.5-5.0 eV for all the compounds also have very similar characteristics. Since in this energy range both the occupied and empty states involved in the interband-absorption peak formation have a 3d character in an energy range, the major factor contributing to the features observed in the OC spectra is the joint-density-of-states (JDOS) effects, and the optical-transition-matrix elements do not play an important role. Co2 Si, whose crystal structure is orthorhombic, has a strong optical anisotropy, as expected. The structural dependence of the electronic band structure for Co silicides has also been evaluated by examining the optical properties of the disordered and the crystalline Co-Si alloy films of the CoSi and CoSi2 stoichiometry. The change in the OC spectra can be explained by "simple" JDOS effects in the DOS curves. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

They are required to exhibit high performance in both visible-range transparency and electronic conductivity simultaneously.

In other words, the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) frequency of TCO is located in NIR spectral regime. On the other hand, the imaginary part of the permittivity is relatively low which implies less optical loss when compared to noble metals. This “metal-like” permittivity dispersion characteristic of TCOs means their capability to support surface plasmons (SPs) in the NIR regime. In this paper, a summary of various physical parameters of commonly used TCOs such as ITO, AZO, and FTO, etc., is given. These parameters include carrier density, carrier mobility, plasma frequency, and ENZ wavelength. The difference among these parameters determines their diverse performance in infrared range.

By using a 20 nm-thick silver superlens, the half-pitch resolution of ~λ0/8 can be achieved with good contrast at a free space wavelength of 435 nm. The resolution of silver superlens can also be improved using shorter illumination wavelength. We show that the thinner the lens, the better the imaging ability of the silver superlens due to the excitation of antisymmetric surface plasmon modes of higher propagation wave vectors. The thickness of lens is varied from 20 to 40 nm in a three layer system, SiO 2-Ag-SiO2.

In-situ high temperature powder XRD found the oxidation mechanism begins with destabilization of ZrN through formation of a ZrN1-x phase with oxide peaks initially detected at around 773 K. The zirconium oxide layer was found to be monoclinic by in-situ XRD with no evidence of tetragonal or cubic polymorphs present to 1023 K. Bulk ceramic samples oxidized at 1173 and 1273 K underwent slower oxidation than those oxidized at 973 and 1073 K. This change in oxidation rate and hence mechanism was due to formation of a denser c-ZrO2 polymorph stabilized by nitrogen defects. This N-doped dense ZrO2 layer acts as a diffusion barrier to oxygen diffusion. However, at an oxidation temperature of 1373 K this layer is no longer protective due to increased diffusion through it resulting in grain boundary oxidation.},

The x-ray diffraction spectra showed that rutile- TiO2 appeared above 600 °C. The relative intensity of TiO2 rapidly increased with temperatures. Only rutile- TiO2 was detected above 700 °C. Raman scattering spectra indicated the presence of rutile- TiO2 signals above 500 °C. Meanwhile an additional Si peak appeared at 700 °C in Raman spectra, above which only Si peak appeared. Many nano pores were found on the surface of films annealed at temperatures between 600 and 700 °C in field emission scanning electron microscopy, while the granular structure existed at 800 °C. The as-deposited TiN films had an apparent columnar structure. The thin and dense oxide overlayer appeared at 500 °C, and thicker oxide layer existed above 600 °C. The elongated grain structure with many voids existed in the film at 800 °C. These pores-voids might result from the nitrogen release during the oxidation of the nitride. The oxide layer obviously grows inward indicating the oxidation of TiN films belongs to an inward oxidation. The pre-exponential factor and the activation energy of the oxidation were evaluated by Arrhenius-type relation. These values were 2.2× 10-6 cm2 s and 110±10 kJmol, which are consistent with those reports in the literature. © 2005 American Vacuum Society.},

The stress state in the as-deposited films was found to be inhomogeneous. Annealing resulted in stress relaxation and reduction of resistivity for all films, except the thinnest, unencapsulated film, which agglomerated. In-plane film grain sizes measured for a subset of the annealed films with thicknesses between 5 and 180 nm surprisingly showed a near constant value (101-116 nm), independent of film thickness. Thick-film (≥120 nm) resistivity values as low as 8.6 μΩcm at 301 K were obtained after annealing at 850 °C for 2 h.

   abstract = {Vanadium and hafnium nitride nanoscale films were synthesized onto (100)-oriented silicon wafers by reactive dc-magnetron sputtering. The temperature of the substrate was fixed at 150 °C. Several analysis techniques were used to characterize the resulting films: Wave Dispersion Spectroscopy (WDS) to determine nitrogen concentration, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) to study crystallographic structures, X-ray Reflectivity (XRR) to estimate their thicknesses and finally optical spectrophotometry (UV-Vis-IR) to measure the optical reflectance. The experimental conditions were selected in order to achieve two goals. The first one is to obtain ultra thin films (in the nanoscale range). The second one is to compare two symmetric systems, in terms of stoichiometry: over-stoichiometric hafnium nitrides and sub-stoichiometric vanadium nitrides. The XRR results showed that all synthesized films approximately presented the same thickness in the nanoscale range (less than 70 nm). The nitrogen concentration, measured by means of WDS, was in the sub-stoichiometric region for vanadium nitrides (N/V atomic ratio between 0.78 and 0.83) and over-stoichiometric region for hafnium nitrides (N/Hf atomic ratio between 1.18 and 1.25). From XRD patterns, the crystallographic film structure was found to be of NaCl type for the two systems, δ-VN and δ-HfN, with an amorphous part in the first system. Optical constants were derived from experimental reflectance spectra. Good agreement was found between experimental and calculated reflectance spectra using Drude and extended Drude models. © 2007 EDP Sciences/Società Italiana di Fisica/Springer-Verlag.},

Furthermore, simultaneous detection of linear and nonlinear signals allows quantitative comparison of both methods, providing further insight into the working principle of our sensor.

We present second-harmonic (SH) spectroscopy of TiN nanoantenna arrays, which is analyzed using a nonlinear oscillator model with a wavelength-dependent second-order response from the material itself. Furthermore, characterization of the robustness upon strong laser illumination confirms that the TiN antennas are able to endure laser irradiation with high peak intensity up to 15 GW/cm2 without changing their optical properties and their physical appearance. They outperform gold antennas by one order of magnitude regarding laser power sustainability.

Thermal damage of the near-field transducer (NFT) and write pole (WP) embedded in the trailing edge of the magnetic head due to failure of the protective carbon overcoat after prolonged heating at an elevated temperature are major obstacles. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to develop an effective coating method for HAMR heads. This was accomplished by introducing a new class of layered coatings consisting of ultrathin amorphous carbon (a-C) overcoat, adhesion (SiN) layer, and buffer (NiCr or TaOx) layer sequentially deposited onto Au and FeCo base layers to mimic the layer stacking of NFT and WP elements, respectively. The structural stability of the a-C overcoats and diffusion characteristics of each comprising layer under conditions of heating at 350 °C for 30 min in an Ar atmosphere were investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). For most stacking configurations the HRTEM/STEM and EELS results generally revealed some layer intermixing and minute carbon atom rehybridization in the heated a-C overcoats. The findings of this investigation suggest that further optimization of the developed layered coatings can provide a viable solution to thermal damage of HAMR heads.},

Titanium nitride (TiN) is an emerging plasmonic material that offers compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, corrosion resistance, as well as mechanical strength and durability, thus outperforming noble metals in terms of cost, mechanical, chemical, and thermal stability. Here, it is shown that plasmonic TiN can inject into TiO2 twice as many hot electrons as Au nanoparticles. TiO2 nanowires decorated with TiN nanoparticles show higher photocurrent enhancement than decorated with Au nanoparticles for photo-electrochemical water splitting. Experimental and theoretical evidence highlight the superior performance of TiN in hot carrier collection due to several factors. First, TiN nanoparticles provide broadband absorption efficiency over the wavelength range 500–1200 nm combined with high field enhancement due to its natural cubic morphology. Second, TiN forms an Ohmic junction with TiO2, thus enabling efficient electron collection compared to Au nanoparticles. Since TiN nanoparticles have strong plasmon resonances in the red, the entire solar spectrum is covered when complemented with Au nanocrystals. These findings show that transition metal nitrides enable plasmonic devices with enhanced performance for solar energy conversion.},

   abstract = {© 2016 Optical Society of America. Efficient broadband absorption of visible and near-infrared light by low quality-factor metal-insulator-metal (MIM) resonators using refractory materials is reported. Omnidirectional absorption of incident light for broad angles of incidence and polarization insensitivity are observed for the fabricated MIM resonator. Excellent thermal stability of the absorber is demonstrated at high operating temperatures (800 °C). The experimental broadband absorption spectra show good agreement with simulations. The resonator with 12 nm top tungsten and 100 nm alumina spacer film shows absorbance above 95% in the range of 650 to 1750 nm. The absorption window is tunable in terms of the center wavelength, bandwidth, and the value of maximum absorbance (~98%) by simple variation of appropriate layer thicknesses. Owing to their flexibility, ease of fabrication and low cost, the presented absorbers have the potential for a wide range of applications, including the use in commonly used infrared bands or absorbers for (solar) thermo-photovoltaic energy conversion, where high absorbance and simultaneously low (thermal) re-radiation is of paramount importance.},

One plasmonic photocatalyst, Au/TiO2, is of a particular interest because it combines chemical stability, suitable electronic structure, and photoactivity for a wide range of catalytic reactions such as water splitting. In this review, we describe key mechanisms involving plasmonics to enhance photocatalytic properties leading to efficient water splitting such as production and transport of hot electrons through advanced analytical techniques used to probe the photoactivity of plasmonics in engineered Au/TiO2 devices. This work also discusses the emerging strategies to better design plasmonic photocatalysts and understand the underlying mechanisms behind the enhanced photoactivity of plasmon-assisted catalysts.},

   abstract = {Enhancement y of the electrical field at the end of a tip relative to the incident field in a focused radiation beam is calculated by the finite-element time-domain (FETD) method. First, the reliability of the FETD method is established by calculating the electric field on simple structures like thin cylinders, spheres, and ellipsoids, and comparing the results with analytical solutions. The calculations on these test structures also reveal that phase retardation effects substantially modify y when the size of the structure is larger than approximately λ/4, λ being the radiation wavelength. For plasmon resonance, in particular, phase retardation severely reduces the resonance and the expected field enhancement for a gold tip. The small value of λ= 4 calculated by FETD is about an order of magnitude smaller than the value found in recent published work. Resonance effects can be recovered for special tips, which have a discontinuity or a different material composition at the end of the tip. Some tuning of the discontinuity dimension is needed to maximize the resonance. Under optimal conditions for plasmon resonance, an enhancement in the electric field of about 50 is calculated at the end of a small gold protrusion mounted on a wider silicon or glass tip. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {Unlike conventional optics, plasmonics enables unrivalled concentration of optical energy well beyond the diffraction limit of light. However, a significant part of this energy is dissipated as heat. Plasmonic losses present a major hurdle in the development of plasmonic devices and circuits that can compete with other mature technologies. Until recently, they have largely kept the use of plasmonics to a few niche areas where loss is not a key factor, such as surface enhanced Raman scattering and biochemical sensing. Here, we discuss the origin of plasmonic losses and various approaches to either minimize or mitigate them based on understanding of fundamental processes underlying surface plasmon modes excitation and decay. Along with the ongoing effort to find and synthesize better plasmonic materials, optical designs that modify the optical powerflow through plasmonic nanostructures can help in reducing both radiative damping and dissipative losses of surface plasmons. Another strategy relies on the development of hybrid photonic-plasmonic devices by coupling plasmonic nanostructures to resonant optical elements. Hybrid integration not only helps to reduce dissipative losses and radiative damping of surface plasmons, but also makes possible passive radiative cooling of nano-devices. Finally, we review emerging applications of thermoplasmonics that leverage Ohmic losses to achieve new enhanced functionalities. The most successful commercialized example of a loss-enabled novel application of plasmonics is heat-assisted magnetic recording. Other promising technological directions include thermal emission manipulation, cancer therapy, nanofabrication, nano-manipulation, plasmon-enabled material spectroscopy and thermo-catalysis, and solar water treatment.},

Here, we have systematically studied the photothermal reshaping behavior of gold nanorods irradiated with femtosecond laser pulses to report that the instability is driven by curvature-induced surface diffusion rather than a threshold melting process, and that the stability dramatically decreases with increasing aspect ratio. We successfully utilized the surface diffusion model to explain the observations and found that the activation energy for surface diffusion was dependent on the aspect ratio of the rods, from 0.6 eV for aspect ratio of 5 to 1.5 eV for aspect ratio less than 3. This result indicates that the surface atoms are much easier to diffuse around in larger aspect ratio rods than in shorter rods and can induce reshaping at any given temperature. Current plasmonics and nanorod applications with the sharp geometric features used for greater field enhancement will therefore need to consider surface diffusion driven shape change even at low temperatures.},

However, plasmonic nanostructures exposed to elevated temperature often experience permanent deformations, which could significantly degrade performance of the plasmonic devices. Therefore, understanding of thermal deformation of plasmonic nanostructures and its influence on the device performance is essential to the development of robust high-performance plasmonic devices. Here, we report thermal deformation of lithographic planar gold nanopatch and nanohole arrays and its influence on surface plasmon resonance sensing. The gold nanostructures are fabricated on a silicon substrate and on the end-face of an optical fiber using electron-beam lithography and focused-ion-beam lithography, respectively. The fabricated gold nanostructures are exposed to cyclic thermal loading in the range of 25 °C to 500 °C. Through experimental and numerical studies, we investigate (i) thermal deformation modes of the gold nanostructures, (ii) influence of the gold nanostructure geometry on the degree and mechanism of the thermal deformation, and (iii) influence of the thermal deformation on performance of surface plasmon resonance sensing. The obtained understanding from these studies is expected to help guide the development of robust high-performance plasmonic sensors for monitoring in elevated temperature environments. Although the current work is focused on gold nanostructures, it can be extended to provide useful insights on thermal deformation of refractory plasmonic nanostructures at extreme temperature.},

   abstract = {Ultra-thin Au films with thickness (h) ranging from 0.5 to 6.0 nm were deposited at room temperature (RT) by means of e-beam evaporation on SiO2 and HfO2. Due to the natural solidstate dewetting (SSD) of the as-deposited films, Au nanoparticles (NPs) were formed on the substrates. By properly adjusting the h value, the size and the density of the Au NPs can be finely tuned. For h = 0.5 nm, spherical-like Au NPs with diameter below 5 nm and density in the order of 1012 Au NPs cm-2 were obtained without any additional thermal treatment independently from the substrate. The dependence of the Au NPs characteristics on the substrate starts to be effective for h ≥ 1.0 nm where the Au NPs diameter is in the 5-10 nm range and the density is around 1011 Au NPs cm-2. The effect of a subsequent high temperature (400-800°C) annealing in N2 atmosphere on the Au NPs was investigated as well. For h ≤ 1.0 nm, the Au NPs characteristics evidenced an excellent thermal stability. Whereas the thermal treatment affects the cristallinity of the Au NPs. For the thicker films (2.0 ≤ h ≤ 6.0 nm), the thermal treatment becomes effective to induce the SSD. The proposed methodology can be exploited for the synthesis of Au NPs with diameter below 10 nm on different substrates at RT.},

It was found that the metastable solid solubilities of Ti, Zr and Hf in gold were 18.2, 13.0, and 13.4 at% respectively, but that those of W, Re, Ru, and Rh in gold were negligible. It is concluded that metastable extension of the solid solubilities of transition metals in gold is relative to the nature of the phase diagrams of their alloys with gold. Under conditions of rapid solidification, the alloys with upper-peritectic-type phase diagrams had significant solid solubility extensions and the alloys with monotectic-type phase diagrams displayed little solid solubility extension.

The central idea is that ε2(ω) is parameterized independently at each node of a properly chosen anchor frequency mesh, while ε1(ω) is dynamically coupled to ε2(ω) by the Kramers-Kronig (KK) transformation. This approach can be regarded as a limiting case of the multioscillator fitting of spectra, when the number of oscillators is on the order of the number of experimental points. In the case of the normal-incidence reflectivity from a semi-infinite isotropic sample the new method gives essentially the same result as the conventional KK transformation of reflectivity. In contrast to the conventional approaches, the proposed technique is applicable, without readaptation, to virtually all types of linear-response optical measurements, or arbitrary combinations of measurements, such as reflectivity, transmission, ellipsometry, etc., done on different types of samples, including thin films and anisotropic crystals. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

In particular, the finite difference time domain method (FDTD) requires an analytical model of dispersion that verifies specific conditions to produce a full spectrum in a single run. Combination of Drude and Lorentz models, and Drude and critical points models, are known to be efficient, but the number of parameters to be adjusted for fitting data can prevent accurate results from simulated annealing or Nelder-Mead. The complex number relative permittivities of Au, Ag, Al, Cr, and Ti from either Palik or Johnson and Christy experimental data in the visible domain of wavelengths are successfully fitted by using the result of the particle swarm optimization method with FDTD constraint, as a starting point for the Nelder-Mead method. The results are well positioned compared to those that can be found in the literature. The results can be used directly for numerical simulations in the visible domain. The method can be applied to other materials, such as dielectrics, and to other domain of wavelengths.},

In this article, plasmonic effects are discussed in terms of three major physical phenomena (incident field enhancement, photon density of states enhancement, and nonradiative decay enhancement) in the context of various photonic processes and devices related to Raman scattering, photo- and electroluminescence, photovoltaics, photochemistry, and photodetectors. A number of instructive examples are given for metal nanospheres and nanorods showing how size, shape, core-shell design, and ambient environment can be used to get maximal use of the favorable factors while keeping unfavorable ones at reasonably safe level. A number of aspects of plasmonically enhanced secondary radiation are emphasized which have not gained close consideration to date. Among them, the following properties are discussed: the decisive role of scattering component of metal-dielectric extinction spectrum overlapping with incident and emitted/scattered light wavelength, valuable contribution to enhancement factors from spacers used to prevent emission quenching but simultaneously affecting the extinction spectrum, a pronounced dependence of enhancement factors on dielectric permittivity of the substrate, dielectric shell, and ambient medium.},

The second goal is to prove that the implementation of a thin titanium nitride (TiN) layer between Ti and Au can remarkably reduce Ti diffusion.

   abstract = {The oxidation behavior of titanium nitride (TiN) films has been investigated by using x-ray diffraction, Raman scattering spectroscopy, and field emission scanning electron microscopy. TiN films were deposited onto Si substrates by using cathodic arc plasma deposition technique. After that, the films were annealed in the air at 500-800 °C for 2 h. The x-ray diffraction spectra showed that rutile- TiO2 appeared above 600 °C. The relative intensity of TiO2 rapidly increased with temperatures. Only rutile- TiO2 was detected above 700 °C. Raman scattering spectra indicated the presence of rutile- TiO2 signals above 500 °C. Meanwhile an additional Si peak appeared at 700 °C in Raman spectra, above which only Si peak appeared. Many nano pores were found on the surface of films annealed at temperatures between 600 and 700 °C in field emission scanning electron microscopy, while the granular structure existed at 800 °C. The as-deposited TiN films had an apparent columnar structure. The thin and dense oxide overlayer appeared at 500 °C, and thicker oxide layer existed above 600 °C. The elongated grain structure with many voids existed in the film at 800 °C. These pores-voids might result from the nitrogen release during the oxidation of the nitride. The oxide layer obviously grows inward indicating the oxidation of TiN films belongs to an inward oxidation. The pre-exponential factor and the activation energy of the oxidation were evaluated by Arrhenius-type relation. These values were 2.2× 10-6 cm2 s and 110±10 kJmol, which are consistent with those reports in the literature. © 2005 American Vacuum Society.},

   abstract = {A universal method of extraction of the complex dielectric function ε(ω) = ε1(ω)+iε2(ω) from experimentally accessible optical quantities is developed. The central idea is that ε2(ω) is parameterized independently at each node of a properly chosen anchor frequency mesh, while ε1(ω) is dynamically coupled to ε2(ω) by the Kramers-Kronig (KK) transformation. This approach can be regarded as a limiting case of the multioscillator fitting of spectra, when the number of oscillators is on the order of the number of experimental points. In the case of the normal-incidence reflectivity from a semi-infinite isotropic sample the new method gives essentially the same result as the conventional KK transformation of reflectivity. In contrast to the conventional approaches, the proposed technique is applicable, without readaptation, to virtually all types of linear-response optical measurements, or arbitrary combinations of measurements, such as reflectivity, transmission, ellipsometry, etc., done on different types of samples, including thin films and anisotropic crystals. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was applied in an anodic potential range, with polished and unpolished crystals, provided with a Cr or Ti adhesion layer. Crystals with Cr undercoatings showed-in HClO4 and in buffer-oxidation currents and frequency shifts due to dissolution of Cr in a potential range in which gold oxidation also takes place. This led to loss of resonance of the crystal and/or to an increase in surface roughness. The deleterious effects of Cr are most pronounced with unpolished crystals. Crystals with Ti undercoatings neither showed a sign of oxidation or dissolution of adhesion metal, nor a significant increase in surface roughness upon repeated cycling, probably due to passivation of Ti by a thin oxide film, and its resistance to dissolution. The small positive frequency shifts observed upon repeated cycling in stirred solutions of HClO4 and phosphate buffer, with unpolished crystals in particular, are most likely due to dissolution of gold. The oxygen chemisorption on gold in HClO4 and in buffer, and the enhanced dissolution of gold in the presence of small concentrations (0.5 mM) of chloride in HClO4, could be very well studied with Ti-coated crystals. For applications in the anodic potential range (extending into the region of oxygen chemisorption on gold), crystals with Cr adhesion layers should not be used. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   abstract = {Efficient adhesion of gold thin films on dielectric or semiconductor substrates is essential in applications and research within plasmonics, metamaterials, 2D materials, and nanoelectronics. As a consequence of the relentless downscaling in nanoscience and technology, the thicknesses of adhesion layer and overlayer have reached tens of nanometers, and it is unclear if our current understanding is sufficient. In this report, we investigated how Cr and Ti adhesion layers influence the nanostructure of 2-20 nm thin Au films by means of high-resolution electron microscopy, complemented with atomic force microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Pure Au films were compared to Ti/Au and Cr/Au bilayer systems. Both Ti and Cr had a striking impact on grain size and crystal orientation of the Au overlayer, which we interpret as the adhesion layer-enhanced wetting of Au and the formation of chemical bonds between the layers. Ti formed a uniform layer under the Au overlayer. Cr interdiffused with the Au layer forming a Cr-Au alloy. The crystal orientation of the Au layers was mainly [111] for all thin-film systems. The results showed that both adhesion layers were partially oxidized, and oxidation sources were scrutinized and found. A difference in bilayer electrical resistivity between Ti/Au and Cr/Au systems was measured and compared. On the basis of these results, a revised and more detailed adhesion layer model for both Ti/Au and Cr/Au systems was proposed. Finally, the implications of the results were analyzed, and recommendations for the selection of adhesion layers for nano-optics and nanoelectronics applications are presented.},

   abstract = {Elevated temperatures and large thermal gradients are a significant source of component failure in microelectronics, and are the limiting factor in heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR). We have investigated the effect of solid-state dewetting in Au thin films, as a function of local temperature, film thickness, and substrate adhesion. In this work, a localized temperature rise is induced in thin (≤50 nm) polycrystalline Au films on SiO2 substrates via focused continuous-wave laser irradiation at 488 nm. The magnitude and distribution of the total temperature rise is measured using CCD-based thermoreflectance. This also allows a sensitive measurement of the temperature at which dewetting occurs, showing that for thin Au films without adhesion layers, rapid dewetting can occur at temperatures as low as 50 °C, which corresponds with an absorbed laser power of 4 mW. The time decay of the reflected light from the illuminating laser is used to monitor locally the dynamics of solid state dewetting. TEM diffraction analysis shows significant changes in the microstructure and crystallographic texture of the films as far as 10 μm away from the illuminated area. The use of a thin metallic adhesion layer (such as Ti or Cr) is shown to significantly improve the adhesion of the Au to the substrate, inhibit grain growth, reduce the tendency towards dewetting, and to allow the film to develop a pseudo-biaxial texture.},

However, surface plasmon resonances experience more damping in lithographically-defined structures than in chemically-synthesized nanoparticles of comparable geometries. Grain boundaries, surface roughness, substrate effects, and adhesion layers have been reported as causes of plasmon damping, but it is difficult to isolate these effects. Using monochromated electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and numerical analysis, we demonstrate an experimental technique that allows the study of these effects individually, to significantly reduce the plasmon damping in lithographically-defined structures. We introduce a method of encapsulated annealing that preserves the shape of polycrystalline gold nanostructures, while their grain-boundary density is reduced. We demonstrate enhanced Q-factors in lithographically-defined nanostructures, with intrinsic damping that matches the theoretical Drude damping limit.},

   abstract = {Silver nanodiscs embedded in a dielectric environment can be used to confine light to their surface, squeezing the electromagnetic fields to form standing waves on the nanoscale. These standing waves can have different wavelengths and define the res- onant modes of the disc. Many such modes exist, but not all of them can couple to a light wave as they need to have a dipole moment, matching the symmetric nature of an electromagnetic wave. These modes are called bright plasmonic modes. Dark plasmonic modes with no dipole moment have been studied with electron energy loss spectroscopy, and in the last years a new type of mode family came to the attention of researchers. Distinct from the well-known edge modes with azimuthal symmetry and nodes around the edge of the disc, these dark film modes are radially symmetric and were termed “breathing modes”. However, for large enough discs in the range of a couple of hundred nanometers retardation effects come into play and can be effectively used to break the symmetry of the system and excite dark modes optically. The coupling of the first order breathing mode (among others) is demonstrated in this thesis using computer simulations. The symmetry restrictions of a dipole-like excitation can also be relaxed by placing an oscillating dipole close enough to a nanodisc so that its field strongly varies locally. Consequently, such emitters can also couple resonantly to dark modes resulting in a faster decay of the emitter. This mechanism allows for radiationless energy transfer between a donor molecule and an acceptor molecule. Our simulations show that the donor can couple to the nanodisc which transfers energy mainly to its nodes where it can be picked up by the acceptor.},

They were evaporated onto soda glass microscope slides at room temperature in a sputter-ion pumped glass belljar vacuum system at about 5×10-8 torr. The films varied in their thickness from 50 to 1100 Å, and the resistivity was very high for the thinnest films but for the thickest ones it approached approximately double the bulk value. The measured resistivities for the continuous freshly prepared films are too high to be explained on the basis of the Fuchs-Sondheimer theory1, 2 for diffuse scattering, and are attributed to porosity and the gaseous impurities taken down during and after their formation. The temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) was negative for films less than 50-60 Å thick but positive for thicker ones. A bulk mean free path of 285 Å in titanium was calculated at room temperature.

Traditional adhesion layer metals Ti and Cr were compared with alternative materials of Al, Ta, and W. Film dewetting was shown to increase when the adhesion material diffuses through the Au layer. An adhesion layer thickness of 0.5 nm resulted in superior thermomechanical stability for all adhesion metals, with an enhancement factor of up to 200× over 5 nm thick analogues. The metals were ranked by their effectiveness in inhibiting dewetting, starting with the most effective, in the order Ta > Ti > W > Cr > Al.

This strategy has a low fabrication efficiency, which limits the applications of plasmonic metamaterials. Here, the absorption efficiency and peak position of the plasmonic metamaterial consisting of Au nanohole array/SiO2 spacer/Au film are tuned by simply controlling the thicknesses of the hexagonal Au nanohole array and the spacer layer, respectively. An ultrahigh absorption of ≈99% and a high surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect (with an average surface enhancement factor of 106) are achieved at the desired laser wavelength. The substrate can be as large as 10 mm in diameter and shows a high uniformity for SERS detection.

The deviceʼs transmission characteristic can be controlled based on the relationship between the wavelength of the incident light and the length of the hybrid waveguide device. The device will transmit only specific incident light wavelengths because the length of the hybrid plasmonic waveguide remains constant. The characteristics of this device indicate potential for applications to nanoscale devices, optical integrated circuits and plasmonic sensors.},

Because of the high confinement of electromagnetic energy, propagating SPPs have been considered to represent one of the best potential ways to construct next-generation circuits that use light to overcome the speed limit of electronics. Many basic plasmonic components have already been developed. In this review, researches on plasmonic waveguides are reviewed from the perspective of plasmonic circuits. Several circuit components are constructed to demonstrate the basic function of an optical digital circuit. In the end of this review, a prototype for an SPP-based nanochip is proposed, and the problems associated with building such plasmonic circuits are discussed. A plasmonic chip that can be practically applied is expected to become available in the near future.},

   abstract = {Optical waveguides are the key building block of optical fiber and photonic integrated circuit technology, which can benefit from active photonic manipulation to complement their passive guiding mechanisms. A number of emerging applications will require faster nanoscale waveguide circuits that produce stronger light-matter interactions and consume less power. Functionalities that rely on nonlinear optics are particularly attractive in terms of their femtosecond response times and terahertz bandwidth, but typically demand high powers or large footprints when using dielectrics alone. Plasmonic nanostructures have long promised to harness metals for truly nanoscale, energy-efficient nonlinear optics. Early excitement has settled into cautious optimism, and recent years have been marked by remarkable progress in enhancing a number of photonic circuit functions with nonlinear plasmonic waveguides across several application areas. This work presents an introductory review of nonlinear plasmonics in the context of guided-wave structures, followed by a comprehensive overview of related experiments and applications covering nonlinear light generation, all-optical signal processing, terahertz generation/detection, electro optics, quantum optics, and molecular sensing.},

The PPMs consist of gold nanocrystal (AuNC) arrays (3rd-Tier) anchored on a hexagonal nanopattern (2nd-Tier) assembled from silica nanoparticles (SiO2NPs) where the uniform microsphere backbone is termed the 1st-Tier. The PPMs sustain both photonic stop band (PSB) properties, resulting from periodic SiO2NP arrangements of the 2nd-Tier, and a surface plasmon resonance (SPR), resulting from AuNC arrays of the 3rd-Tier. Thanks to the synergistic effects of the photonic crystal (PC) structure and the AuNC array, the electromagnetic (EM) field in such a multiscale composite structure can tremendously be enhanced at certain wavelengths. These effects are demonstrated by experimentally evaluating the Raman enhancement of benzenethiol (BT) as a probe molecule and are confirmed via numerical simulations. We achieve a maximum SERS enhancement factor of up to â108 when the resonances are tailored to coincide with the excitation wavelength by suitable structural modifications.},

From the perspective of sustainable development of the LSPR based applications, it is important to find metallic materials that are cheap and plentiful and show excellent hot carrier properties. In this context, we investigate the possibility of alloying Au with Al to develop efficient LSPR materials for hot carriers-based applications. Taking thermodynamically stable AuAl2 and AuAl as examples, we study their electronic structures, generation rates, energetic distribution, relaxation times, and mean free paths of hot carriers originating from direct and phonon-assisted indirect electronic transitions, which are two of the main channels for generating high-energy hot carriers from the decay of LSPR, and compare the results with that of Au and Al metals. It is found that both AuAl2 and AuAl show larger hot carrier generation rates than Au and the resulting hot carriers are energetically higher than that in Au. Meanwhile, the transport properties of hot carriers in AuAl2 and AuAl outperform that of Au, which is manifested through comparable or even longer relaxation times and mean free paths. Consequently, it is believed that the Au-Al intermetallic compounds should be a series of efficient LSPR materials for hot carriers-based applications, which is comparable with or even better than the noble metal Au. These results are helpful for the sustainable development of related fields.},

The ultracompact cavity produces extremely strong optical near-fields, which facilitate the formation of single carbon quantum dots in the cavity and simultaneously empower the strong coupling between the excitons of the formed carbon quantum dot and the localized surface plasmons. This is manifested in the optical scattering spectra, showing a magnificent Rabi splitting of up to 200 meV under ambient conditions. In addition, we demonstrate that the strong coupling is tuneable with light irradiation. This opens new paradigms for investigating the fundamental light emission properties of carbon quantum dots in the quantum regime and paves the way for many significant applications.},

The experimental reflectivity and EELS were measured for PtAl2 and showed good agreement with the theoretical spectra. The yellow color of PtAl2 is associated with a bulk plasmon at 3 eV. We predict that the optical properties of hypothetical intermediate alloys would show a smooth evolution with composition. The details of this change can be understood by examination of the underlying density of states (DOS). The predicted small sphere extinction spectra and quality factors show a strong surface plasmon resonance for these materials, with PtAl2 having the optimum performance.

However, a major concern arises from the stability of metal nanoparticles, particularly at a high temperature, as the diffusion and conglomeration of the nanoparticles will undermine the very basis for the advantageous plasmonic effect. We here carried out a systematic investigation of the thermal stability of different metal nanoparticles coated on 3D Si-based NPs and found that simple Al2O3 encapsulation could help stabilize the gold (Au) particles coated on Si NPs even when subjected to annealing at >1073 K while accomplishing excellent broadband optical absorption (∼95%) from 200 nm to 2500 nm. This could be assigned mainly to the excellent dispersion retention capability of the Al2O3-encapsulated Au nanoparticles and the beneficial plasmon resonance absorption among the Au nanoparticles and Si NPs, as also revealed from the FDTD simulation analysis. Finally, a rapid vapor generation application was demonstrated based on the optimized Au/Si NPs, where salt water drops could be directly injected onto the high-temperature photo-heated Au/Si NPs and could vaporize/bounce off quickly without leaving any salt precipitation on the surface. This new strategy can also pave the way for high-performance Si-based photothermal applications.},

Here, applying electron energy-loss spectroscopy to individual silver nanoparticles encapsulated in silicon nitride, we observe besides the usual dipole resonance an additional surface plasmon resonance corresponding to higher angular momenta for nanoparticle radii as small as 4 nm. We study the radius and electron beam impact position dependence of both resonances separately. For particles smaller than 4 nm in radius the higher-order surface plasmon mode disappears, in agreement with generalized non-local optical response theory, while the dipole resonance blueshift exceeds our theoretical predictions. Unlike in optical spectra, multipole surface plasmons are important in electron energy-loss spectra even of ultrasmall metallic nanoparticles.},

   abstract = {It has been widely shown that gold nanoparticle emission wavelength redshifted when the diameter of the gold nanoparticle increases. This redshift is universally dependent not only to nanoparticles' size but also on their shape, type of metal, or the environment dielectric constant. However, the latter contribution is extremely difficult to be characterize experimentally due to the complexity of synthesize and method of determining the thickness and dielectric constant of the shell. In this paper, we resolved those issues by calculating the extinction efficiency of dielectric core-metal nanoshell plasmon resonance nanostructure using silica and gold template respectively. The calculation was conducted using MATLAB toolbox on metallic nanoparticle using boundary element method (MNPBEM), deploying a full Maxwell's equation in this simulation of silica core-gold nanoshells. The total silica core-gold nanoshell diameter in defining the plasmon resonance was specifically analysed, determined from the coupling of the inner shell surface (cavity) and the outer shell surface (sphere) plasmons over a separation distance given by the gold nanoshell thickness, to be consistent with the published work on plasmon hybridization model. By using this silica-gold nanoshell, surface plasmon resonance was shown to achieve a higher wavelength position near infrared region. The hybridization of the outer shell-surface sphere mode and inner shell-surface sphere cavity mode reveal that gold nanoshell is more suitable to in-vivo imaging and therapy application as compared to gold nanosphere.},

   abstract = {Nanoantennas for visible and infrared radiation can strongly enhance the interaction of light with nanoscale matter by their ability to efficiently link propagating and spatially localized optical fields. Gold nanoparticles are the material that is mostly used experimentally, since it combines a favorable dielectric function in the red and near-IR with excellent chemical stability. So, the gold material is used to build nanoantennas in this research. The optical properties of plasmonic dimer nanoantennas are investigated in detail using the finite integration technique. The validity of this technique is verified by comparison to the exact solution generalized Mie method (GMM). The influence of the geometrical parameters (antenna length, gap dimension, and shapes) on the antenna field enhancement and spectral response is discussed. Localized surface plasmon resonances of Au (gold) dimers nanospheres, bowtie and aperture bowtie nanoantennas are modeled. The enhanced field is equivalent to a strong light spot which can lead to the resolution improvement of the microscopy and optical lithography, thus increasing the optical data storage capacity. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the antennas to index changes of the environment and substrate is investigated in detail for biosensing applications. We confirm that our approach yields an exact correspondence with GMM theory, for Au dimers nanospheres at gap dimension 5 and 10 nm but gives an approximation error of less than 1.37 % for gap dimension 1 and 2 nm with diameters approaching 80 nm. In addition, the far-field characteristics of the aperture bowtie nanoantenna such as directivity and gain are studied. The promising results of this study may have useful potential applications in near-field sample detection, optical microscopy, etc. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Using in situ electron energy loss spectroscopy in a transmission electron microscope, we map the spectral and spatial changes in the plasmonic modes as they hybridize and evolve from a weak to a strong coupling regime. In the strongly-coupled regime, we observe a very large mechanical tunability (~250 meV/nm) of the bonding-dipole plasmon resonance of the dimer at ~1 nm gap spacing, right before detrimental quantum effects set in. We leverage our findings to realize a prototype NEMS light-intensity modulator operating at ~10 MHz and with a power consumption of only 4 fJ/bit.},

The typical setup in EELS requires nanoparticles to be supported on thin substrates. However, as in optical measurements, the substrate material can modify the acquired signal. Here, we have investigated how the EELS signal recorded from supported silver and gold spheroidal nanoparticles at different electron beam impact parameter positions is affected by the choice of a dielectric substrate material and thickness. Consistent with previous optical studies, the presence of a dielectric substrate is found to red-shift localized surface plasmons, increase their line widths, and lead to increased prominence of higher order modes. The extent of these modifications heightens with increasing substrate permittivity and thickness. Specific to EELS, the results highlight the importance of the beam impact parameter and substrate-related Čerenkov losses and charging. Our experimental results are compared with and corroborated by full-wave electromagnetic simulations based on the boundary element method. The results present a comprehensive study of substrate-induced modifications in EELS and allow identification of optimal substrates relevant for EELS studies of plasmonic structures.},

Using basic models of impurity doping in semiconductors, transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) are identified as low-loss plasmonic materials in the near-infrared wavelength range. A more sophisticated theoretical study would help not only to improve the properties of TCOs but also to design further lower-loss materials. In this study, optical functions of one such TCO, gallium-doped zinc oxide (GZO), are studied both experimentally and by first-principles density-functional calculations. Pulsed-laser-deposited GZO films are studied by the x-ray diffraction and generalized spectroscopic ellipsometry. Theoretical studies are performed by the total-energy-minimization method for the equilibrium atomic structure of GZO and random phase approximation with the quasiparticle gap correction. Plasma excitation effects are also included for optical functions. This study identifies mechanisms other than doping, such as alloying effects, that significantly influence the optical properties of GZO films. It also indicates that ultraheavy Ga doping of ZnO results in a new alloy material, rather than just degenerately doped ZnO. This work is the first step to achieve a fundamental understanding of the connection between material, structural, and optical properties of highly doped TCOs to tailor those materials for various plasmonic applications.},

However, these nano-apertures typically have very poor power throughput behavior when the sizes of the apertures are much smaller than the wavelength of the incident light. In this paper, we use numerical simulation tool XFDTD, which is a three-dimensional vector electro-magnetic field simulator based on the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method, to study the behavior of the nano-apertures. We show that for square apertures, the power throughput decays as r4 (r is the size of the aperture) when the aperture size r is less than lamda/4 (lamda is the incident light wavelength). To solve the power throughput shortage problem, we present our novel nano-aperture design -'C'-aperture. Compared with a conventional 100nm square aperture, the 'C'-aperture provides 1000x higher power throughput while maintaining a comparable near field spot size.

The different synthetic strategies that have been developed to achieve decent yields and sample monodispersity are then described, and the methods used for physical characterization as well as results of inorganic structure studies follow. Some of the most innovative research dealing with surface modification and chemical reactivity of gold nanorods is highlighted, together with new directions such as the synthesis of core-shell particles and the interactions of gold nanorods with biomolecules. Gold nanorods can be excited by ultrafast laser-induced heating; the resulting relaxation processes are important in determining the material properties of the metal particles. In addition, vibrational modes and shape changes are elucidated, and a theoretical analysis of the expected behavior is also presented. The incorporation of the gold nanorods into thin films and gels provides a new avenue for designing and growing materials with anisotropic optical properties.

Plasmonic metal nanostructures are able to localize and manipulate the light at the nanoscale and, therefore, are attractive building blocks for various emerging applications. In particular, hollow nanostructures are promising plasmonic materials as cavities are known to have better plasmonic properties than their solid counterparts thanks to the plasmon hybridization mechanism. The hybridization of the plasmons results in the enhancement of the plasmon fields along with more homogeneous distribution as well as the reduction of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) quenching due to absorption.

In the second part of this review, we discuss the advancements on the characterization of plasmonic properties of hollow nanostructures, covering the single nanoparticle experiments, nanoscale characterization via electron energy-loss spectroscopy and modeling and simulation studies.

   abstract = {The influence of the deposition rate of titanium thin films on their microscopic structure has been investigated by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analyses and atomic force microscopy. Furthermore, the resistivity of the films has been characterized by van der Pauw measurements in a temperature range of 5-300 K. Titanium films with a thickness of 10 nm evaporated with a rate of 1 Å/s showed the typical and well known temperature dependency of the resistivity (i.e. decreasing resistivity with falling temperature). In contrast, the resistivity of thin films deposited with a rate of 0.2 Å/s rises with decreasing temperature. Additionally, the resistivity of the films evaporated with the lower rate rises significantly when reducing their film thickness down to 3 nm. Due to this increase of the resistivity we are able to present an alternative and relatively simple approach for the fabrication of single electron transistors (SETs). The presented SET design is based on the evaporated thin titanium films with a deposition rate of 0.2 Å/s onto well defined trenches previously etched into a dielectric layer of thermally grown silicon dioxide. The tunnel junctions originate from a local increase of the resistance of the metallic wire at the edges of the trenches. The devices fabricated in this manner with lateral dimensions in the 50-100 nm range show clear SET features at an operating temperature of up to 77 K. Additionally, the influence of background charges on the Coulomb oscillations in this devices are demonstrated and discussed in comparison with simulated data. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The augmented-plane-wave energy band structure of these solids was incorporated into the theory through εl(q→,ω) which was calculated in the self-consistent-field formalism. The calculated dispersion relations show striking deviations from the corresponding free-electron calculations in three respects. First, the plasmons are considerably damped by the presence of interband transitions, with general trend towards increased damping for increasing values of the wave vector. Second, the zero-wave-vector plasma frequency is smaller than the corresponding free-electron plasma frequency. Finally, the dispersion curves are very different from those for free electrons.

The optical absorption, the induced charge response, and the frequency dependent current demonstrate that the main plasmon resonance modes are the charge transfer plasmon mode and the bonding dimer plasmon mode (BDP). Moreover, there are also two small hybridized plasmon modes. The induced field enhancement of each spatial region depends on the gap distance and the plasmon mode. For the narrow gap, the field enhancement at different positions of the straight line segments between two nanorings is almost uniformly distributed. However, for large separations, along the axial direction, the field enhancement gradually decreases in the region within the radius of the sodium atom. Then, the change of the field enhancement is nonlinear. For different plasmon modes, there is a different number of field enhancement extrema. The largest extreme value is located in the middle region. These findings are expected to play an important role in designing plasmonic nanostructures for practical applications that require coupled metallic nanoparticles with enhanced electric fields. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

It is shown that in the small Na nanoparticles up to 2 nm in size, the loss function Im[ϵ-1] is dominated by a single peak corresponding to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). For particles of 2 nm and more, a resonance corresponding to surface plasmon polariton (SPP) oscillations begins to form, as well as a resonance corresponding to volume plasmon (VP) excitations. Considering the above, the linear size of a particle in the range of 0.7-3.7 nm can be estimated as the lower limit for metal nanodevices operating with SPPs. On the example of spherical nanoparticles consisting of a silicon core coated with sodium atoms, it is shown that the LSPR mode is selectively suppressed while the SPP mode is not. Such composite structures can be considered as an example of nanoplasmonic devices with selectively tuned characteristics.},

   abstract = {Transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) are emerging as possible alternative constituent materials to replace noble metals such as silver and gold for low-loss plasmonic and metamaterial (MM) applications in the near infrared regime (NIR). The optical characteristics of TCOs have been studied to evaluate the functionalities and potential of these materials as metal substitutes in plasmonic and MM devices, even apart from their usual use as electrode materials. However, patterning TCOs at the nanoscale, which is necessary for plasmonic and MM devices, is not well studied. This paper investigates nanopatterning processes for TCOs, especially the liftoff technique with electron-beam lithography, and the realization of plasmonic nanostructures with TCOs. By employing the developed nanopatterning process, we fabricate 2-D-periodic arrays of TCO nanodisks and characterize the material's plasmonic properties to evaluate the performance of TCOs as metal substitutes. Light-induced collective oscillations of the free electrons in the TCOs (bulk plasmons) and localized surface plasmon resonances are observed in the wavelength range from 1.6 to 2.1 μm. Well-defined resonance peaks are observed, which can be dramatically tuned by varying the amount of dopant and by thermally annealing the TCO nanodisks in nitrogen gas ambient while maintaining the low-loss properties. © 1995-2012 IEEE.},

Monochromated electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) has in recent years demonstrated its value as a qualitative experimental technique in nano-optics and plasmonic due to its unprecedented spatial resolution. Here, we demonstrate that EELS can also be used quantitatively, to probe surface plasmon kinetics and damping in single nanostructures. Using this approach, we present from a large (>50) series of individual gold nanoparticles the plasmon Quality factors and the plasmon Dephasing times, as a function of energy/frequency. It is shown that the measured general trend applies to regular particle shapes (rods, spheres) as well as irregular shapes (dendritic, branched morphologies). The combination of direct sub-nanometer imaging with EELS-based plasmon damping analysis launches quantitative nanoplasmonics research into the sub-nanometer realm.},

   abstract = {Plasmonic devices, made of apertures or antennas, have played significant roles in advancing the fields of optics and opto-electronics by offering subwavelength manipulation of light in the visible and near infrared frequencies. The development of heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) opens up a new application of plasmonic nanostructures, where they act as near field transducers (NFTs) to locally and temporally heat a sub-diffraction limited region in the recording medium above its Curie temperature to reduce the magnetic coercivity. This allows use of very small grain volume in the medium while still maintaining data thermal stability, and increasing storage density in the next generation hard disk drives (HDDs). In this paper, we review different plasmonic NFT designs that are promising to be applied in HAMR. We focus on the mechanisms contributing to the coupling and confinement of optical energy. We also illustrate the self-heating issue in NFT materials associated with the generation of a confined optical spot, which could result in degradation of performance and failure of components. The possibility of using alternative plasmonic materials will be discussed.},

The typical setup in EELS requires nanoparticles to be supported on thin substrates. However, as in optical measurements, the substrate material can modify the acquired signal. Here, we have investigated how the EELS signal recorded from supported silver and gold spheroidal nanoparticles at different electron beam impact parameter positions is affected by the choice of a dielectric substrate material and thickness. Consistent with previous optical studies, the presence of a dielectric substrate is found to red-shift localized surface plasmons, increase their line widths, and lead to increased prominence of higher order modes. The extent of these modifications heightens with increasing substrate permittivity and thickness. Specific to EELS, the results highlight the importance of the beam impact parameter and substrate-related Čerenkov losses and charging. Our experimental results are compared with and corroborated by full-wave electromagnetic simulations based on the boundary element method. The results present a comprehensive study of substrate-induced modifications in EELS and allow identification of optimal substrates relevant for EELS studies of plasmonic structures.},

   abstract = {Intercoupling of an incident electric field in metal nanoparticles causes asymmetric distribution of surface charges, which eventuates in shifting of the surface plasmon resonance frequency. This feature can be used in tuning the surface plasmon resonance and controlling the light absorption in a desired wavelength. This work provides a theoretical study of the plasmonic properties of complex gold nanostructures on a dielectric substrate where the nanoparticles have different morphologies. For analysis, we have developed a discrete dipole approximation with surface interactions-z, which is the third version of the MATLAB-based DDA-SI toolbox. In this version, lower-upper decomposition of the interaction matrix is used as a preconditioning of the LSQR iterative solver. This method accelerates the DDA-SI calculations by decreasing the total number of iteration steps and decreases the relative residual to achieve more accurate results. In the analysis, nanostructures are assumed to be gold dimers, trimers, and quadrumers with different sizes and elongations of cubical or spherical geometries on a BK7 substrate. The results show that absorption spectra exhibit both red-and blueshifted plasmon resonances in array, depending on the particle shape and elongation. The cubic structure of gold array provides the highest absorption efficiency, while the spherical structures give wider bandwidth; the combination of these structures could be used to design a system with intended features. We demonstrate that the geometrical symmetry plays an important role in the plasmon resonance of gold arrays, and it is shifted when the symmetry of the array is broken.},

The finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulation method is used to assign the absorption and scattering peaks and also to calculate the plasmon field intensity for AgNCs. Because AgNCs have a highly symmetric cubic shape, there is a uniform distribution of the plasmon field around them, and they are thus sensitive to asymmetric dielectric perturbations. When the dielectric medium around a nanoparticle is changed anisotropically, either by placing the particle on a substrate or by coating it asymmetrically with a solvent, the plasmon field is distorted, and the plasmonic absorption and scattering spectra could shift differently. For the 60 nm AgNC, we found that the scattering resonance peak shifted more than the absorption peak. This changes the extinction bandwidth of these overlapping absorption and scattering bands, and consequently the figure of merit of the nanoparticle, as a localized SPR sensor, no longer has a constant value. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

The plasmonic properties of metal nanoparticles can change significantly with changes in particle size, shape, composition, and arrangement. Thus, stabilization of the fabricated nanoparticles is crucial for preservation of the desired plasmonic behavior. Because plasmonic nanoparticles find application in diverse fields, a variety of different stabilization strategies have been developed. Often, stabilizers also function to enhance or improve the plasmonic properties of the nanoparticles. This review provides a representative overview of how gold and silver nanoparticles, the most frequently used materials in current plasmonic applications, are stabilized in different application platforms and how the stabilizing agents improve their plasmonic properties at the same time. Specifically, this review focuses on the roles and effects of stabilizing agents such as surfactants, silica, biomolecules, polymers, and metal shells in colloidal nanoparticle suspensions. Stability strategies for other types of plasmonic nanomaterials, lithographic plasmonic nanoparticle arrays, are discussed as well.},

In particular, the finite difference time domain method (FDTD) requires an analytical model of dispersion that verifies specific conditions to produce a full spectrum in a single run. Combination of Drude and Lorentz models, and Drude and critical points models, are known to be efficient, but the number of parameters to be adjusted for fitting data can prevent accurate results from simulated annealing or Nelder-Mead. The complex number relative permittivities of Au, Ag, Al, Cr, and Ti from either Palik or Johnson and Christy experimental data in the visible domain of wavelengths are successfully fitted by using the result of the particle swarm optimization method with FDTD constraint, as a starting point for the Nelder-Mead method. The results are well positioned compared to those that can be found in the literature. The results can be used directly for numerical simulations in the visible domain. The method can be applied to other materials, such as dielectrics, and to other domain of wavelengths.},

Analysis of the deposition process provides us with information about the high deposition rate, the nucleation stage, and the homogeneity in depth of the deposited film.

Polycrystalline thin films having thicknesses in the range of 10–100 nm were ultrahigh vacuum sputter deposited on thermally grown SiO2 surfaces. The films were annealed at temperatures in the range of 150–800 °C in argon and argon+3% hydrogen gases. Scanning electron microscopy was used to investigate the agglomeration behavior, and transmission electron microscopy was used to characterize the microstructure of the as-deposited and annealed films. The agglomeration sequence in all of the films is found to follow a two step process of void nucleation and void growth. However, void growth in Au and Pt thin films is different from Cu and Ru thin films. Residual stress and adhesion were observed to play an important part in deciding the mode of void growth in Au and Pt thin films. Last, it is also observed that the tendency for agglomeration can be reduced by encapsulating the metal film with an oxide overlayer.},

Here we report on the synthesis of nanoporous gold thin films using a free-corrosion approach in nitric acid applied to cosputtered Au-Cu thin films. A relationship is established between the as-grown Au-Cu film characteristics (i.e., composition, morphology, and structure) and the porosity of the sponge-like gold thin films. We further demonstrate that the dealloying approach can be applied to nonhomogenous Au-Cu alloy thin films consisting of periodic and alternate Au-rich/Au-poor nanolayers. In such a case, however, the dealloying process is found to be altered and unusual etching stages arise. Thanks to defects and column boundaries playing the role of channels, the nitric acid is found to quickly penetrate within the films and then laterally (i.e., parallel to the film surface) attacks the nanolayers rather than perpendicularly. As a consequence to this anisotropic etching, the Au-poor layers are etched preferentially and transform into Au pillars holding the Au-rich layers and preventing them against collapsing. A further exposure to nitric acid results in the collapsing of the Au-rich layers accompanied by a transition from a multilayered to a sponge-like structure. A scenario, supported by experimental observations, is further proposed to provide a detailed explanation of the fundamental mechanisms occurring during the dealloying process of films with a multilayered structure.},

A systematic study of the effect of film-surface misalignment revealed that the values of thickness were insensitive to the alignment. A precision of about 1% or less was obtained from off-specular reflectivity data with a surface misalignment of 0.20° or less. The insensitivity makes conventional powder diffractometers attractive for film thickness determination and opens this technique to many laboratories.

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully.

Instead of manually identifying the potential constituent chemical components from the ROI and determining the chemical state of each spectral component from the SI data stored in a huge three-dimensional matrix, it is more effective and efficient to use a statistical approach for the automatic resolution and extraction of the underlying chemical components. Among many different statistical approaches, we adopt a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) technique, mainly because of the natural assumption of non-negative values in the spectra and cardinalities of chemical components, which are always positive in actual data. This paper proposes a new NMF model with two penalty terms: (i) an automatic relevance determination (ARD) prior, which optimizes the number of components, and (ii) a soft orthogonal constraint, which clearly resolves each spectrum component. For the factorization, we further propose a fast optimization algorithm based on hierarchical alternating least-squares. Numerical experiments using both phantom and real STEM-EDX/EELS SI datasets demonstrate that the ARD prior successfully identifies the correct number of physically meaningful components. The soft orthogonal constraint is also shown to be effective, particularly for STEM-EELS SI data, where neither the spatial nor spectral entries in the matrices are sparse.},

   abstract = {This review discusses how low-energy valence excitations created by swift electrons can render information on the optical response of structured materials with unmatched spatial resolution. Electron microscopes are capable of focusing electron beams on subnanometer spots and probing the target response either by analyzing electron energy losses or by detecting emitted radiation. Theoretical frameworks suited to calculate the probability of energy loss and light emission (cathodoluminescence) are reconsidered and compared with experimental results. More precisely, a quantum-mechanical description of the interaction between the electrons and the sample is discussed, followed by a powerful classical dielectric approach that can be applied in practice to more complex systems. The conditions are assessed under which classical and quantum-mechanical formulations are equivalent. The excitation of collective modes such as plasmons is studied in bulk materials, planar surfaces, and nanoparticles. Light emission induced by the electrons is shown to constitute an excellent probe of plasmons, combining subnanometer resolution in the position of the electron beam with nanometer resolution in the emitted wavelength. Both electron energy-loss and cathodoluminescence spectroscopies performed in a scanning mode of operation yield snapshots of plasmon modes in nanostructures with fine spatial detail as compared to other existing imaging techniques, thus providing an ideal tool for nanophotonics studies. © 2010 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {We present universal modal decompositions of the quasistatic electromagnetic local density of states (EMLDOS) of nanoparticles in the presence of dissipation and for arbitrary materials. This relies on a generic and universal description of the optical eigenmodes in arbitrary structures. In this description, already developed in various former theories, the eigenmodes are independent of the energy, scale invariant, and depend only on the structures shapes. For these reasons, we call the modes geometric eigenmodes. A direct analogy with the well-known modal decomposition of the EMLDOS in the case of nondissipative photonic modes is drawn in the special case of a material described by a Drude's model. Moreover, we show that this formalism is suitable to describe the electron energy loss spectroscopy and some scanning near optical field microscopy experiments. The link between such experiments and the mapping of the geometric mode is analyzed. In particular, this allows us to show that the delocalization of the inelastic signal can be interpreted as a convolution of the surface eigencharges at the boundary of the particle with the Coulombian interaction that arises in both experimental set up. A local density of states for the geometric eigenmodes depending only on the geometry of the particle is introduced, by analogy with the well-known EMLDOS for the photonic eigenmodes. This density of states and the related Green's functions, which have a very simple and concise form, are shown to be capable of generating all relevant quantities in the quasistatic approximation. Finally, we discuss the impact of the energy dispersion of the dielectric functions on the loss of spatial coherence of the geometric eigenmodes. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

Here we report a new 50-nm-resolution nanoscope that uses optically transparent microspheres (for example, SiO 2, with 2 μm<diameter< μm) as far-field superlenses (FSL) to overcome the white-light diffraction limit.

   abstract = {Scanning electron microscopy is widespread in field of material science and research, especially because of its high surface sensitivity due to the increased interactions of electrons with the target material's atoms compared to X-ray-oriented methods. Among the available techniques in scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) is used to gather information regarding the crystallinity and the chemistry of crystalline and amorphous regions of a specimen. When post-processing the diffraction patterns or the image captured by the EBSD detector screen which was obtained in this manner, specific imaging contrasts are generated and can be used to understand some of the mechanisms involved in several imaging modes. In this manuscript, we reviewed the benefits of this procedure regarding topographic, compositional, diffraction, and magnetic domain contrasts. This work shows preliminary and encouraging results regarding the non-conventional use of the EBSD detector. The method is becoming viable with the advent of new EBSD camera technologies, allowing acquisition speed close to imaging rates. This method, named dark-field electron backscatter diffraction imaging, is described in detail, and several application examples are given in reflection as well as in transmission modes.},

The latter has been measured here in a wide range of solids and a scaling law λ ∼ ρ-0.3 versus mass density ρ has been revealed.

When carried out in a modern transmission electron microscope, EELS is capable of giving structural and chemical information about a solid, with a spatial resolution down to the atomic level in favourable cases. The energy resolution is typically 1 eV but can approach 0.1 eV if an electron-beam monochromator is used. This review provides an overview of EELS instrumentation and of the physics involved in the scattering of kilovolt electrons in solids. Features of the energy-loss spectrum are discussed, including plasmon peaks, inner-shell ionization edges and fine structure related to the electronic densities of states. Examples are given of the use of EELS for the measurement of local properties, including specimen thickness, mechanical and electronic properties (such as bandgap) and chemical composition. Factors that determine the spatial resolution of the analysis are outlined, including radiation damage to the specimen. Comparisons are made with related techniques, particularly x-ray absorption spectroscopy. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The thin ZrO2(111) films were grown on a Pt(111) substrate. At room temperature, Au initially grows as 2D islands on the ZrO 2(111) thin films up to 0.1 ML, followed by 3D growth with a number density of ∼1.4 × 1012 particles/cm2. The binding energy of the Au 4f peaks shifts monotonically toward a higher binding energy with decreasing the Au particle size by 0.4 eV, which can be attributed to the contribution from both the initial- and final-state effects. Au atoms most likely form Auδ- initially and become metallic states as the coverage increases. Thermal annealing experiments demonstrate that Au particles experience significant sintering before desorption from the ZrO 2(111) surface. In addition, Au particles are more thermally stable on the sputtered ZrO2(111) surface than on the pristine ZrO 2(111) surface due to the stronger bonding of Au atoms on the surface defect sites. Moreover, large Au particles are more thermally stable than small ones on the ZrO2(111) surface. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {The use of a metallic adhesion layer is known to increase the thermo-mechanical stability of Au thin films against solid-state dewetting, but in turn results in damping of the plasmonic response, reducing their utility in applications such as heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR). In this work, 50 nm Au films with Ti adhesion layers ranging in thickness from 0 to 5 nm were fabricated, and their thermal stability, electrical resistivity, and plasmonic response were measured. Subnanometer adhesion layers are demonstrated to significantly increase the stability of the thin films against dewetting at elevated temperatures (>200 °C), compared to more commonly used adhesion layer thicknesses that are in the range of 2-5 nm. For adhesion layers thicker than 1 nm, the diffusion of excess Ti through Au grain boundaries and subsequent oxidation was determined to result in degradation of the film. This mechanism was confirmed using transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy on annealed 0.5 and 5 nm adhesion layer samples. The superiority of subnanometer adhesion layers was further demonstrated through measurements of the surface-plasmon polariton resonance; those with thinner adhesion layers possessed both a stronger and spectrally sharper resonance. These results have relevance beyond HAMR to all Ti/Au systems operating at elevated temperatures.},

   abstract = {Solid films are usually metastable or unstable in the as-deposited state, and they will dewet or agglomerate to form islands when heated to sufficiently high temperatures. This process is driven by surface energy minimization and can occur via surface diffusion well below a film's melting temperature, especially when the film is very thin. Dewetting during processing of films for use in micro- and nanosystems is often undesirable, and means of avoiding dewetting are important in this context. However, dewetting can also be useful in making arrays of nanoscale particles for electronic and photonic devices and for catalyzing growth of nanotubes and nanowires. Templating of dewetting using patterned surface topography or prepatterning of films can be used to create ordered arrays of particles and complex patterns of partially dewetted structures. Studies of dewetting can also provide fundamental new insight into the effects of surface energy anisotropy and facets on shape evolution. © Copyright ©2012 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.},

In this work in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy has been used to study the dewetting behavior of discontinuous Au thin films (15 nm and 22 nm thick) on amorphous silicon nitride membranes at temperatures ranging from 300 °C to 600 °C. The combination of microscopic and statistical information enabled not only the qualitative discussion of the observed processes but also the quantification of the kinetics as well as the development of a model of the underlying morphological mechanism. A model-free master curve approach to the temporal evolution of the covered area at different temperatures is used to determine the activation energy of dewetting (1.04±0.14eV for the 15 nm thick film). A closer inspection reveals a multiple power law behavior, which is discussed in the frame of depercolation. Retraction of finger-like structures is found to be the dominant morphological mechanism based on the observed linear relationship between covered area and boundary length.},

   abstract = {Nominally identical permalloy nanowires, with widths down to 150 nm, were fabricated onto a single-electron transparent Si 3 N 4 membrane using electron beam lithography (EBL) and focused ion beam (FIB) milling. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were performed to compare the nanostructures produced by these two techniques in what we believe is the first direct comparison of fabrication techniques for nominally identical nanowires. Both EBL and FIB methods produced high quality structures with edge roughness being of the order of the mean grain size 5-10 nm observed in the continuous films. However, significant grain growth was observed along the edges of the FIB patterned nanowires. Lorentz TEM in situ imaging was carried out to compare the magnetic behavior of the domain walls in the patterned nanowires with anti-notches present to pin domain walls. The overall process of domain wall pinning and depinning at the anti-notches showed consistent behavior between nanowires fabricated by the two methods with the FIB structures having slightly lower characteristic fields compared to the EBL wires. However, a significant difference was observed in the formation of a vortex structure inside the anti-notches of the EBL nanowires after depinning of the domain walls. No vortex structure was seen inside the anti-notches of the FIB patterned nanowires. Results from micromagnetic simulations suggest that the vortex structure inside the anti-notch can be suppressed if the saturation magnetization (M s) is reduced along the nanowire edges. A reduction of M s along the wire edges may also be responsible for a decrease in the domain wall depinning fields. Whereas the two fabrication methods show that well-defined structures can be produced for the dimensions considered here, the differences in the magnetic behavior for nominally identical structures may be an issue if such structures are to be used as conduits for domain walls in potential memory and logic applications. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {This works reports on the development of nanoplasmonic thin films, composed of Au nanoparticles embedded in an Al2O3 matrix. The Au-Al2O3 thin films were deposited by magnetron sputtering, and then subjected to thermal treatments (in-air) to promote the growth of the Au nanoparticles. The change of the number of gold pellets placed in the erosion zone of the aluminium target, originated Au concentrations in the films from 8.9 at.% to 20.7 at.%. While the Al2O3 matrix remained roughly stoichiometric and amorphous after the thermal treatment, a progressive crystallization of the Au nanoparticles was observed when the annealing temperature increased from 400 °C to 700 °C. Nonetheless, the amorphous matrix limited the growth of Au nanoparticles up to 20 nm. Moreover, the application of an argon plasma treatment enabled the removal of superficial layers, increasing the density of Au nanoparticles partially exposed at the films’ surface. Envisaging the application in localized surface plasmon resonance sensors, the thin films were tested using two dielectric (liquid) environments, showing a consistent response under different H2O/DMSO cycles, yet with low sensitivities (few nm/RIU). To enhance the sensitivity of these thin film system other strategies are discussed.},

Bio-functionality of natural nano-structures has recently drawn the attention of bioengineers to mimic the high-resolution nanostructures on the metallic substrate. However, hydrothermal, wet and dry etching methods have a good throughput to fabricate the metallic nano-structures, the resolution and morphology control has been restricted. Recent advances in particle beam lithography (Focused ion beam lithography and electron beam lithography) are able to fabricate the high-resolution nanostructure on metals. The advantage of particle beam lithography is to control the nanostructure morphology via optimizing the process variable. This paper reviewed the throughput and resolution of particle beam lithography including Electron beam lithography (EBL), focused ion beam milling (FIB) and Ion Beam Induced Deposition (IBID) to fabricate metallic nano-structure sub-200nm pattern. The outcome of this research could guide bioengineers to select the best approach to fabricate sub-200nm features on the metallic substrate.},

The potential induced by a moving electron is expressed in terms of surface-charge distributions placed at the interfaces. These surface charges, obtained by self-consistently solving the resulting integral equation, act back on the electron producing a retarding force and hence energy loss. The dielectrics are described by frequency-dependent dielectric functions. Two particular cases are discussed in further detail: interfaces invariant under translation along one particular direction and axially symmetric interfaces. Previous results for simple geometries, such as planes, spheres, and cylinders, based upon analytical solutions, are fully reproduced within this approach. Calculations are presented for electrons moving near wedges, coupled parallel cylinders, coupled spheres, and toroidal surfaces. © 1997 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {Energy resolution is one of the most important parameters in electron energy-loss spectroscopy. This is especially true for measurement of surface plasmon resonances, where high-energy resolution is crucial for resolving individual resonance peaks, in particular close to the zero-loss peak. In this work, we improve the energy resolution of electron energy-loss spectra of surface plasmon resonances, acquired with a monochromated beam in a scanning transmission electron microscope, by the use of the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algorithm. We test the performance of the algorithm in a simulated spectrum and then apply it to experimental energy-loss spectra of a lithographically patterned silver nanorod. By reduction of the point spread function of the spectrum, we are able to identify low-energy surface plasmon peaks in spectra, more localized features, and higher contrast in surface plasmon energy-filtered maps. Thanks to the combination of a monochromated beam and the Richardson-Lucy algorithm, we improve the effective resolution down to 30 meV, and evidence of success up to 10 meV resolution for losses below 1 eV. We also propose, implement, and test two methods to limit the number of iterations in the algorithm. The first method is based on noise measurement and analysis, while in the second we monitor the change of slope in the deconvolved spectrum. Copyright © 2014 Microscopy Society of America.},

   abstract = {Heat-Assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) is a new technology which uses temporary near-field heating of the media during write to increase hard disk drive storage density. By using a plasmonic antenna embedded in the write head, an extremely high thermal gradient is created in the recording media (up to 10 K/nm). State-of-The-Art HAMR media consist of grains of L10-FePt exhibiting high perpendicular anisotropy separated by 1-2 nm-Thick carbon segregant. Next to the plasmonic antenna, the difference of temperature between two nanosized FePt grains in the media can reach 80 K across the 2 nm-Thick grain boundary. This represents a gigantic local thermal gradient of 40 K/nm across a carbon tunnel barrier. In the field of spincaloritronics, much weaker thermal gradients of 1 K/nm were shown to cause a thermal spin-Transfer torque (TST) capable of inducing magnetization switching in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Considering on the one hand, two neighboring grains separated by an insulating grain boundary in an HAMR media can be viewed as an MTJ, and on the other hand, the thermal gradients in HAMR are 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than those used in the conventional spincaloritronic experiments; one may expect a strong impact from these TSTs on magnetization switching dynamics in HAMR recording. This issue has been totally overlooked in the previous investigations on the development of the HAMR technology. This paper combines theory, experiments aiming at determining the polarization of tunneling electrons across the media grain boundaries, and micromagnetic simulations of the recording process taking into account these thermal gradients. It is shown that the thermal in-plane torque can have a detrimental impact on the recording performances by favoring antiparallel magnetic alignment between neighboring grains during the media cooling. Implications on media design are discussed in order to overcome the influence of these thermal torques. Suggestions of spincaloritronic experiments taking advantage of these huge thermal gradients produced by plasmonic antenna are also given.},

The capabilities of these new instruments are still being explored, and here we study the effect of monochromation on various aspects of EELS analysis in the infrared (<1 eV) regime. We investigate the effect of varying levels of monochromation on energy resolution, zero-loss peak (ZLP) tail reduction, ZLP tail shape, signal-to-noise-ratio, and spatial resolution. From these experiments, the new capabilities of monochromated EELS are shown to be highly promising for the future of localized spectroscopic analysis.},

We numerically analyze how light is transported through the waveguide and ultimately focused via effective-mode coupling and taper optimization. Crucial dimensional parameters in this optimization process are identified that are not only necessary to achieve maximum optical throughput, but also optimum thermal performance with specific application towards heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR). It is shown that existing devices constructed on similar waveguides may benefit from a heat spreader to avoid deformation of the plasmonic element which we achieve with no cost to the optical efficiency.

It is found that GGA corrections are needed to obtain low-temperature phase transitions under pressure that are consistent with experiment, i.e., (monoclinic→ orthorhombic-I→cotunnite). The GGA values of the bulk modulus of the cotunnite phase are found to be 251 and 259GPa for ZrO2 and HfO2 respectively, highlighting the similarity of these two compounds. We introduce a population analysis scheme in which atomic radii are adapted to the actual charge distribution in the material. The results indicate that the effective atomic radius of Hf is smaller than that of Zr, a drastic manifestation of the relativistic lanthanide contraction. The population analysis demonstrates that ionicity: (i) decreases from the monoclinic to the cotunnite phase, and (ii) is larger for HfO2 than for ZrO2. The bandgap and heat of formation are also larger for monoclinic HfO2 than for ZrO2 by 0.60eV and 0.60eV/formula unit, respectively.

Based on this insight, the stronger performance decline of hafnocenes is ascribed to electrophilicitydependent stabilization effects.},

From autonomous cars to humanoid robots and from intelligent personal assistants to smart home devices, the world around us is undergoing a fundamental change, transforming the way we live, work, and play. Imagine being awoken and tended to by a virtual personal assistant that advises you on what clothing from your wardrobe is best suited to the weather report and your schedule for the day or being transported by your self-driving car. Or perhaps you won't need to commute to an office at all as technology will allow you to conjure workspaces out of thin air using interactive surfaces, and holographic teleconferencing becomes the norm for communicating virtually with colleagues. Weekends may involve browsing new furniture through an augmented reality app and seeing how a sofa looks in your living room before placing an order. As you relax on the new sofa, Saturday night's takeout will be a pizza made by a robot and delivered in record time by a drone. Data has become critical to all aspects of human life over the course of the past 30 years; it's changed how we're educated and entertained, and it informs the way we experience people, business, and the wider world around us. It is the lifeblood of our rapidly growing digital existence. This digital existence, as defined by the sum of all data created, captured, and replicated on our planet in any given year is growing rapidly, and we call it the " global datasphere " . In just the past 10 years society has witnessed the transition of analog to digital. What the next decade will bring using the power of data is virtually limitless. While we as consumers will enjoy the benefits of a digital existence, enterprises around the globe will be embracing new and unique business opportunities, powered by this wealth of data and the insight it provides. Extracting and delivering simplicity and convenience from the complexity of many billions of bytes – be it through},

The structural properties of granular high anisotropy chemically ordered L10 FePtX-Y HAMR media by now are similar to perpendicular CoCrPt-based magnetic recording media. Reasonable average grain diameter ⟨D⟩ = 8–10 nm and distributions σD/D ∼ 18% are possible despite elevated growth \r\ntemperatures TG = 650–670 °C. A 2× reduction of ⟨D⟩ down to 4–5 nm and lowering σD/D < 10%–15% are ongoing efforts to increase AD to ∼4 Tb/in.2. X = Cu ∼ 10 at. % reduces the Curie temperature TC by ∼100 K below TC,bulk = 750 K, thereby lowering the write head heat energy requirement. Multiple FePtX-Y granular layers with Y = 30–35 vol. % grain-to-grain segregants like carbides, oxides, and/or nitrides are used to fully exchange decouple the grains and achieve cylindrical shape. FePt is typically grown on fcc MgO (100) seedlayers to form well oriented FePt (002). A FePt lattice parameter ratio c/a ∼0.96 and high chemical order S > 0.90 result in magnetic anisotropy KU ∼ 4.5 × 107 erg/cm3, and only 25% below the FePt single crystal value KU = 6.6 × 107 erg/cm3 has been achieved in 7–8 nm diameter grains. Switching field distributions depend on anisotropy field (HK) distributions, which are currently of the order of ΔHK/HK ∼ 10% (ΔHK ∼ 10–12 kOe, HK ∼ 10–11 T) at room temperature. High thermal conductivity heat sink layers, including Ag, Au, Cu, and Cr, are used to optimize the cooling rate and maximize the down- and cross-track thermal gradient, which determines the achievable track density.},

   abstract = {Increasing the density of data storage is crucial to the future of inexpensive digital technology. The large majority of storage in the Cloud consists of magnetic hard-disk drives. The continued evolution of this USD$30 billion industry depends on the commercial introduction of heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR). This technology uses heat from a laser beam confined well below the diffraction limit, <50-nm wide, to write to media near 450°C with high magnetic anisotropy that would normally be unwriteable under available magnetic fields. This high anisotropy guarantees thermal stability even for grain sizes around 5-nm diameter, which are necessary for major increases in storage density. In this article and in the articles in this issue, we introduce HAMR requirements and discuss its numerous interdisciplinary materials challenges, including high-temperature/efficient plasmonic materials, low-loss optical materials, highly ordered/thermally anisotropic nanoscale magnetic grains, block copolymers for directed assembly below 10 nm, high-temperature nanometer-thick coatings/lubricants, materials/interfaces to control heat flow at nanometer length scales, and advanced spintronic materials.},

Spectral tunability is achieved by changing the cross arm length and the angle between the arms.

The particle's symmetry is shown to have a crucial influence on the plasmon coupling to incident radiation. Pronounced dipole, quadrupole, octupole and Fano resonances are observed in individual cross structures. Furthermore, the nanocross geometry proves to be a useful building block for coherently coupled plasmonic dimers and trimers where the reduced symmetry results in hybridized subradiant and superradiant modes and multiple Fano interferences. Finite difference time domain calculations of absorption and scattering cross-sections as well as charge density profiles are used to reveal the nature of the different plasmon modes.

When compared to bright modes, dark modes have longer lifetimes due to their lack of a net dipole moment, making them attractive for a number of applications. We demonstrate the excitation and optical detection of a collective dark plasmonic mode from individual plasmonic trimers. The trimers consist of triangular arrangements of gold nanorods, and due to this symmetry, the lowest-energy dark plasmonic mode can interact with radially polarized light. The experimental data presented confirm the excitation of this mode, and its assignment is supported with an electrostatic approximation wherein these dark modes are described in terms of plasmon hybridization. The strong confinement of energy in these modes and their associated near fields hold great promise for achieving strong coupling to single photon emitters. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

The modification of these surface plasmons by different surrounding media and the presence of a substrate or other nanoparticles is also discussed. We found that polyhedral nanoparticles composed with less faces show more surface plasmon resonances, and as the nanoparticle becomes more symmetric, the main surface plasmon resonance is blue-shifted. It is also found that the corners induce more surface plasmons in a wider energy range. In the presence of a substrate, multipolar plasmon resonances are induced, and as the nanoparticle approaches the substrate, such resonances are red-shifted. The interaction among nanoparticles also induces multipolar resonances, but they can be red or blue-shifted depending on the polarization of the external field. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Fano resonances in plasmonic nanostructures, characterized by their asymmetric resonance spectral profile, are currently attracting much interest due to their potential applications in biological sensing, metamaterials, photoswitching, and nonlinear optical devices. In this study, we report on the observation of the Fano resonance in Au nanorods induced by their coupling with the supporting substrate. For Au nanorods having a large size and deposited on a substrate with a large dielectric constant, the strong nanorod-substrate coupling gives rise to a Fano line shape on the far-field scattering spectrum. Electrodynamic calculations reveal that the Fano resonance originates from the interference of a broad octupolar and a narrow quadrupolar plasmon mode of the nanorod. Such an interaction is enabled by the strong image charges induced by substrates with high dielectric constants. Moreover, the Fano resonance is very sensitive to the nanorod-substrate spacing. When the spacing is experimentally increased to be larger than ∼8 nm, the Fano resonance disappears. These results will be important not only for understanding the interference of different plasmon modes in plasmonic systems but also for developing a number of plasmon-based optical and optoelectronic devices. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

Based on first-principles time-dependent density-functional-theory calculations, we find a discontinuous evolution of the plasmonic response as the nanorod is stretched.

   abstract = {© 2016 Optical Society of America. Self-consistent optical constants of SiO2and Ta2O5films have been obtained for their relevance in optical coatings from the near ultraviolet to the near infrared spectral ranges, where they are transparent and have a high refractive index contrast. Particular attention has been paid to wavelengths close to and shorter than each material cutoff. The far and the extreme ultraviolet ranges are also covered here, where few (SiO2) or almost no optical constant data (Ta2O5) were available for films of these materials. This work is aimed at filling the lack of self-consistent sets of optical constants with data in a very broad spectral range, which can be widely applied in multilayer design for the everyday use of these materials in multilayer coatings. Oxide films were deposited by reactive electron-beam evaporation onto various sorts of substrates at 573 K. Transmittance, reflectance, and ellipsometry measurements were performed for each oxide in spectral intervals jointly covering from the extreme ultraviolet to the near infrared; starting with these measurements along with extrapolations, an iterative and double Kramers-Kronig analysis procedure has been followed to obtain a self-consistent set of optical constants per material. With the final data sets, we have satisfactorily reproduced the experimental measurements. Global data selfconsistency was successfully evaluated through sum rules, and local consistency at each photon energy range was also evaluated through a novel sum-rule method which involves window functions.},

The meas-ured data are used to describe a model where each layer refers to a given material. The model uses mathematical relations called dispersion formulae that help to evaluate the thickness and optical properties of the material by adjusting specific fit parameters. This technical note deals with the Cauchy and related empirical transparent dispersion formulae to calculate the real (n) and imaginary (k) parts of the complex refractive index for a material. Theoretical Model Equation of Cauchy Transparent The earliest dispersion formula was established by Cauchy (1836) who set up simple empirical dispersion law. The " Cauchy Transparent " dispersion works best when the material has no optical absorption in the visi-ble spectral range and consequently generally has a normal dispersion which means a monotonous de-creasing refractive index with increasing wavelength in this way: The following equation connects the refractive index to the wavelength (in nm):},

Samples may be prepared rapidly, at least as fast as those prepared using conventional gallium FIB. Moreover, the surface quality after 2 kV final polishing with the Xe beam is exceptional with only about 3 nm of amorphized surface present. The sample quality was of a suitably high quality to allow atomic resolution high-angle annular dark field imaging and integrated differential phase contrast without any further preparation, and the resulting images were good enough for quantitative evaluation of atomic positions to reveal the oxygen octahedral tilt pattern. This suggests that such xenon plasma FIB instruments may find widespread application in transmission electron microscope and scanning transmission electron microscope specimen preparation.},

This is especially true for high-resolution scanning electron and helium ion microscopes, which are proving to be extremely useful for nanometer-scale imaging, characterization, and dimensional measurements. Excellent resolution is essential for imaging nanomaterials. Hence, there is a relentless quest to achieve better and better resolution with various electron and ion microscopes and to monitor and maintain these instruments to achieve the best possible performance levels.The ability to resolve fine details with a microscope has greatly improved over the past 20 years. The resolution achievable with the newest scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) can now be at or below 0.4 nm and for the scanning helium ion microscope (HeIM), 0.24 nm has been reported. To put this into perspective, the \{111\} crystal plane in silicon (Si) has 0.32 nm lattice spacing, so one cubic nanometer in the Si crystal contains only a few atoms. Therefore, an instrument must be performing at the highest level possible to resolve routinely the finest structures. Clearly, the instrument operator must also be functioning at a high level as well to achieve the best resolution and to prove that the instrument is capable of doing the work.},

These detectors can be designed in many shapes and forms but in commercially available SEMs two semiconductor detectors (A and B) are usually placed below the polepiece where they are used for compositional (A plus B) and topographic (A-B) contrast enhancement. The range of SSD applications available from BSE is quite extensive. The kind and quality of information depend strongly on the shape and position of the detector in relation to the specimen and the electron beam. Also very important is the current gain vs. electron energy dependence, which can be controlled by detector manufacturing technology.

   abstract = {The plasmon resonances of two closely spaced metallic particles have enabled applications including single-molecule sensing and spectroscopy, novel nanoantennas, molecular rulers, and nonlinear optical devices. In a classical electrodynamic context, the strength of such dimer plasmon resonances increases monotonically as the particle gap size decreases. In contrast, a quantum mechanical framework predicts that electron tunneling will strongly diminish the dimer plasmon strength for subnanometer-scale separations. Here, we directly observe the plasmon resonances of coupled metallic nanoparticles as their gap size is reduced to atomic dimensions. Using the electron beam of a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), we manipulate pairs of ∼10-nm-diameter spherical silver nanoparticles on a substrate, controlling their convergence and eventual coalescence into a single nanosphere. We simultaneously employ electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) to observe the dynamic plasmonic properties of these dimers before and after particle contact. As separations are reduced from 7 nm, the dominant dipolar peak exhibits a redshift consistent with classical calculations. However, gaps smaller than ∼0.5 nm cause this mode to exhibit a reduced intensity consistent with quantum theories that incorporate electron tunneling. As the particles overlap, the bonding dipolar mode disappears and is replaced by a dipolar charge transfer mode. Our dynamic imaging, manipulation, and spectroscopy of nanostructures enables the first full spectral mapping of dimer plasmon evolution and may provide new avenues for in situ nanoassembly and analysis in the quantum regime. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

The preparation of metal nanostructures with superior SERS performances is one of the main topics in the SERS field and is important for the applications of SERS in sensing and analysis. In this feature article, we review several different kinds of metal structures for SERS, including coupled metal nanostructures, nanostructure arrays, nano/micro structures with textured surfaces and graphene-mediated SERS substrates. Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) using the metal tip of the scanning tunneling microscope is also discussed. Besides the intensity enhancement in SERS and TERS, some less studied aspects are highlighted; for example, the remote excitation technique, tuning the nanogap of gold nanorod dimers through strain control on an elastomeric substrate, manipulating Raman emission polarization using asymmetric nanoantennas, and investigating plasmon-enhanced chemical reactions by TERS. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Many of these electrons undergo inelastic scattering and their energy loss provides information about the chemical and structural properties of the specimen. The instrumentation required for EELS and energy-filtered imaging is described, together with the features found in a typical energy-loss spectrum. Examples are given of practical applications of plasmon-loss and core-loss spectroscopy, as well as energy-filtered imaging. Finally, EELS is compared with other spectroscopic techniques in terms of range of application, sensitivity, spatial resolution and radiation damage. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Nearly eighty years ago, Scherzer showed that rotationally symmetric, charge-free, static electron lenses are limited by an unavoidable, positive spherical aberration. Following a long struggle, a major breakthrough in the spatial resolution of electron microscopes was reached two decades ago by abandoning the first of these conditions, with the successful development of multipole aberration correctors. Here, we use a refractive silicon nitride thin film to tackle the second of Scherzer's constraints and demonstrate an alternative method for correcting spherical aberration in a scanning transmission electron microscope. We reveal features in Si and Cu samples that cannot be resolved in an uncorrected microscope. Our thin film corrector can be implemented as an immediate low cost upgrade to existing electron microscopes without re-engineering of the electron column or complicated operation protocols and can be extended to the correction of additional aberrations.},

An algorithm combining a Monte Carlo method and molecular dynamics was employed to study the thermal effects in thin-film media. The component of the field perpendicular to the plane defined by the axes of shape anisotropy and uniaxial crystalline anisotropy makes it necessary to use the three-dimensional energy surface to find the minimum energy barrier. This barrier is used to sample the reversal rate and the elapsed time. Hysteresis loops for various K uV/kT ratios and sweep times are simulated. Isolated and di-bit transitions are written, taking into account thermally assisted switching. After the head field is turned off, the subsequent thermal decay is computed for time spans as long as 6 months. Significant aftereffect is found for grain volumes about twice that for ordinary superparamagnetism.},

The relation between the `apparent' crystallite size, as determined by X-ray methods, and the `true' size is considered for crystallites having the same shape.

   abstract = {Scherrer Equation, L=Kλ/β.cosθ, was developed in 1918, to calculate the nano crystallite size (L) by XRD radiation of wavelength λ (nm) from measuring full width at half maximum of peaks (β) in radian located at any 2θ in the pattern. Shape factor of K can be 0.62 - 2.08 and is usually taken as about 0.89. But, if all of the peaks of a pattern are going to give a similar value of L, then β.cosθ must be identical. This means that for a typical 5nm crystallite size and λ Cukα1 = 0.15405 nm the peak at 2θ = 170° must be more than ten times wide with respect to the peak at 2θ = 10°, which is never observed. The purpose of modified Scherrer equation given in this paper is to provide a new approach to the kind of using Scherrer equation, so that a least squares technique can be applied to minimize the sources of errors. Modified Scherrer equation plots lnβ against ln(1/cosθ) and obtains the intercept of a least squares line regression, ln=Kλ/L, from which a single value of L is obtained through all of the available peaks. This novel technique is used for a natural Hydroxyapatite (HA) of bovine bone fired at 600°C, 700°C, 900°C and 1100°C from which nano crystallite sizes of 22.8, 35.5, 37.3 and 38.1 nm were respectively obtained and 900°C was selected for biomaterials purposes. These results show that modified Scherrer equation method is promising in nano materials applications and can distinguish between 37.3 and 38.1 nm by using the data from all of the available peaks.},

An electron beam focused to nanometer dimensions thus functions as a point source that is able to probe the local plasmonic mode structure at deep-subwavelength resolution. In this article, we show how well-controlled coupling between an electron beam and surface plasmons, combined with a far-field detection system, allows characterization and manipulation of plasmons on a variety of plasmonic devices. By mapping the spatial profile of inelastic scattering to resonant modes, the dispersion and losses of surface plasmons are resolved. The technique further allows probing of the confinement of plasmons within cavities and measuring the angular emission profile of nanoantennas. The coupling of electrons to surface plasmons allows the use of the electron beam as a dipole emitter that can be positioned at will. The beam position thereby can select between modes with different symmetries. This effect can be used to exert forces on plasmonic structures on the nanometer length scale with great control. © 2012 Materials Research Society.},

   abstract = {Layered metal/dielectric hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs) support a wide landscape of plasmon polariton excitations. In addition to surface plasmon polaritons, coupled Bloch-like gap-plasmon polaritons with high modal confinement inside the multilayer are supported. Photons can excite only a subset of these polaritonic modes, typically with a limited energy and momentum range in respect to the wide set of high-K modes supported by hyperbolic dispersion media, and coupling with gratings or local excitation is necessary. Strikingly, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in a scanning transmission electron microscope allows nm-scale local excitation and mapping of the spatial field distribution of all the modes supported by a photonic or plasmonic structure, both bright and dark, and also all other inelastic interactions of the beam, including phonons and interband transitions. Herein, experimental evidence of the spatial distribution of plasmon polaritons in multilayered type II HMM nanostructures is acquired with an aloof electron beam adjacent to structures of current interest. HMM pillars are useful for their separation and adjustability of optical scattering and absorption, while HMM slot cavities can be used as waveguides with high field confinement. The nature of the modes is confirmed with corresponding simulations of EEL and optical spectra and near-field intensities.},

As the chain length is increased by the addition of one more gold particle to the chain, the new N + 1 mode becomes the highest energy mode, while the existing modes lower their energy and eventually asymptote as they delocalize along the chain.

   abstract = {In this paper, we explore the optical contributions of the substrate to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectrum of surface confined Ag nanoparticles produced by nanosphere lithography (NSL). We present optical extinction spectra of Ag nanoparticles fabricated on the following substrates: fused silica, borosilicate optical glass, mica, and SF-10-a high refractive index specialty glass. For all the experiments discussed here, the Ag nanoparticles were approximately 100 nm in in-plane width and 25 nm in out-of-plane height. In a controlled N2 environment, the wavelength corresponding to the extinction maximum, λmax, shifts to the red with increasing refractive index of the substrate, nsUbstrate- The sensitivity factor, Δλmax/ΔλsUbstrate, was measured to be 87 nm per refractive index unit (RIU). Experimental extinction spectra were modeled using the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). The DBA theory qualitatively predicts the experimentally observed trend that λmax is linearly dependent on nsubstrate; however, the theory overestimates the sensitivity by approximately a factor of 2. The sensitivity of the LSPR to the refractive index of bulk external solvent, nexternal, was also examined for each of the four substrates listed above. For all the cases, the change in λmax in response to bulk external solvent was linearly dependent upon nexternal. Values of the sensitivity factors, Δλmax/Δnexternal, ranged from 206 nm RIU-1 for mica to 258 nm RIU-1 for SF-10, a difference of only 25%. From the results presented here, we conclude that there is no systematic dependence, or at most a weak dependence, which correlates the bulk solvent sensitivity of the LSPR to nsubstrate. The DDA theory overestimates the LSPR sensitivity to bulk external environment, but the ratio of solvent to substrate sensitivity factors is correct within experimental uncertainty. This ratio has a value of approximately 2, which indicates that there is greater sensitivity in the optical response to the solvent than to the substrate. This ratio is within 10% of the ratio of areas of the particles that are exposed to solvent and substrate. We suggest that chemical interactions at the interfaces between the nanoparticle and the substrate and/or the nanoparticle and the bulk environment contribute significantly to the observed difference between experimental and theoretical sensitivity factors. © 2001 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {This review covers a wide range of nanofabrication techniques developed for nanoelectronic devices, nanophotonic metamaterials and other nanostructures, based on electron beam lithography (EBL). Differing from earlier publications, this review particularly focuses on how to apply the property of EBL resists for constructing multilayer stacks towards pattern transfer. Most frequently used resists and their lithography property are first introduced, followed by categorizing multiple layers of resists for fulfilling various tasks in nanofabrication. Particularly, T shape gates for high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), metallic tunneling junctions (MTJs) in single electron tunneling transistors (SETs), chiral structures and photonic crystals for optical metamaterials, templates for NIL and etching masks for nanoscale reactive ion etch (RIE) are reviewed. In the description of process development, scientific advances behind these fabricated nanostructures are described at the same time. By this way, this review aims to indicate that the development of nanofabrication techniques is essential for the rapid advances of nanoscience as a whole.},

   abstract = {Localized surface plasmon resonances have attracted much attention due to their ability to enhance light-matter interactions and manipulate light at the subwavelength level. Recently, alternatives to the rare and expensive noble metals Ag and Au have been sought for more sustainable and large-scale plasmonic utilization. Mg supports plasmon resonances, is one of the most abundant elements in earth's crust, and is fully biocompatible, making it an attractive framework for plasmonics. This feature article first reports the hexagonal, folded, and kite-like shapes expected theoretically from a modified Wulff construction for single crystal and twinned Mg structures and describes their excellent match with experimental results. Then, the optical response of Mg nanoparticles is overviewed, highlighting Mg's ability to sustain localized surface plasmon resonances across the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared electromagnetic ranges. The various resonant modes of hexagons, leading to the highly localized electric field characteristic of plasmonic behavior, are presented numerically and experimentally. The evolution of these modes and the associated field from hexagons to the lower symmetry folded structures is then probed, again by matching simulations, optical, and electron spectroscopy data. Lastly, results demonstrating the opportunities and challenges related to the high chemical reactivity of Mg are discussed, including surface oxide formation and galvanic replacement as a synthetic tool for bimetallics. This Feature Article concludes with a summary of the next steps, open questions, and future directions in the field of Mg nanoplasmonics.},

The range of cutting-edge applications based on single-digit-nanometer scale structures has expanded with the development of nanofabrication technologies. However, challenges still remain in overcoming fabrication limits, such as scalability, controllability, and reproducibility for further practical applications of the sub-10 nm nanostructures. In this review, we discuss the recent advances in top-down nanofabrication methods towards single-digit-nanometer-sized structures. The well-known examples include electron beam lithography (EBL), focused ion beam (FIB) milling or lithography, atomic layer deposition (ALD), and other unconventional techniques to obtain sub-10 nm nanostructures or nanogaps. We discuss state-of-the-art applications for sub-10 nm nanophotonics such as optical trapping or sensing devices, imaging devices, and electronic devices.},

   abstract = {We report on the structural and optical properties of individual bowtie nanoantennas both on glass and semiconducting GaAs substrates. The antennas on glass (GaAs) are shown to be of excellent quality and high uniformity reflected by narrow size distributions with standard deviations for the triangle and gap size of σsglass = 4.5 nm (σsGaAs = 2.6 nm) and σgglass = 5.4 nm (σgGaAs = 3.8 nm), respectively. The corresponding optical properties of individual nanoantennas studied by differential reflection spectroscopy show a strong reduction of the localised surface plasmon polariton resonance linewidth from 0.21 eV to 0.07 eV upon reducing the antenna size from 150 nm to 100 nm. This is attributed to the absence of inhomogeneous broadening as compared to optical measurements on nanoantenna ensembles. The inter-particle coupling of an individual bowtie nanoantenna, which gives rise to strongly localised and enhanced electromagnetic hotspots, is demonstrated using polarization-resolved spectroscopy, yielding a large degree of linear polarization of φmax ∼ 80%. The combination of highly reproducible nanofabrication and fast, non-destructive and non-contaminating optical spectroscopy paves the route towards future semiconductor-based nano-plasmonic circuits, consisting of multiple photonic and plasmonic entities.},

We characterize the localized surface plasmon resonances (SPRs) of gold nanodisks of various diameters and heights while varying the thickness of the Ti adhesion layers. Scattering, absorption, and extinction coefficient calculations show a significant dependence of the SPR on the size of nanostructures and the adhesion layer thickness. Comparisons of peak resonance wavelengths of different Ti adhesion layer thicknesses indicate a significant red shift and a reduction in amplitude as the Ti thickness increases. A comparison of spectral broadening of the plasmon mode indicates a linear increase with Ti thickness and percentage. In addition, the decay time of the plasmon mode decreased significantly as the adhesion layer size increases. These observations aid in understanding size dependent adhesion layer effects and optimized fabrication of single nanoplasmonic structures.},

@article{Jain2007,
   abstract = {Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) in lithographically fabricated gold (Au) nanodisc pairs are investigated using microabsorption spectroscopy and electrodynamic simulations. In agreement with previous work, we find that the fractional plasmon wavelength shift for polarization along the interparticle axis decays nearly exponentially with the interparticle gap. In addition, we find that the decay length is roughly about 0.2 in units of the particle size for different nanoparticle size, shape, metal type, or medium dielectric constant. The near-exponential distance decay and the interesting "universal" scaling behavior of interparticle plasmon coupling can be qualitatively explained on the basis of a dipolar-coupling model as being due to the interplay of two factors: the direct dependence of the single-particle polarizability on the cubic power of the particle dimension and the decay of the plasmonic near-field as the cubic power of the inverse distance. Using this universal scaling behavior, we are able to derive a "plasmon ruler equation" that estimates the interparticle separation between Au nanospheres in a biological system from the observed fractional shift of the plasmon band. We find good agreement of the interparticle separations estimated using this equation with the experimental observations of Reinhard et al.

   abstract = {We report on the optical properties of single isolated silver nanodisks and pairs of disks fabricated by electron beam lithography. By systematically varying the disk size and surface separation and recording elastic scattering spectra in different polarization configurations, we found evidence for extremely strong interparticle interactions. The dipolar surface plasmon resonance for polarization parallel to the dimer axis exhibited a red shift as the interdimer separation was decreased; as expected from previous work, an extremely strong shift was observed. The scattering spectra of single particles and pairs separated by more than one particle radius can be well described by the coupled dipole approximation (CDA), where the particles are approximated as point dipoles using a modified dipole polarizability for oblate spheroids. For smaller particle separations (d < 20 nm), the simple dipole model severely underestimates the particle interaction, indicating the importance of multipolar fields and finite-size effects. The discrete dipole approximation (DDA), which is a finite-element method, describes the experimental results well even at d < 20 nm, including particles that have metallic bridges.},

   abstract = {Plasmonic nanoantennas, which can efficiently convert light from free space into sub-wavelength scale with the local field enhancement, are fundamental building blocks for nanophotonic systems. Predominant design methods, which exploit a single type of near-or far-field coupling in pairs or arrays of plasmonic nanostructures, have limited the tunability of spectral response and the local field enhancement. To overcome this limit, we are developing a general strategy towards exploiting the coordinated effects of multiple coupling. Using Au bowtie nanoantenna arrays with metalinsulator-metal configuration as examples, we numerically demonstrate that coordinated design and implementation of various optical coupling effects leads to both the increased tunability in the spectral response and the significantly enhanced electromagnetic field. Furthermore, we design and analyze a refractive index sensor with an ultra-high figure-of-merit (254), a high signal-to-noise ratio and a wide working range of refractive indices, and a narrow-band near-infrared plasmonic absorber with 100% absorption efficiency, high quality factor of up to 114 and a wide range of tunable wavelength from 800 nm to 1,500 nm. The plasmonic nanoantennas that exploit coordinated multiple coupling will benefit a broad range of applications, including label-free bio-chemical detection, reflective filter, optical trapping, hot-electron generation, and heat-assisted magnetic recording.},

   abstract = {The exposure distribution function in electron beam lithography, which is needed to perform proximity correction, is usually simulated by Monte Carlo techniques, assuming a Gaussian distribution of the primary beam. The resulting backscattered part of the exposure distribution is usually also fitted to a Gaussian term. In this paper we demonstrate a technique, using a very high contrast resist, whereby the normalized point exposure distribution can be measured experimentally, both on solid substrates which cause backscattering, and on thin substrates where backscattering is negligible. The data sets so obtained can be applied directly to proximity correction and represent the practical conditions met in pattern writing. Results are presented of the distributions obtained on silicon, gallium arsenide, and thin silicon nitride substrates at different beam energies. Significant deviations from the commonly assumed double Gaussian distributions are apparent. On GaAs substrates the backscatter distribution cannot adequately be described by a Gaussian function. Even on silicon a significant amount of exposure is found in the transition region between the two Gaussian terms. This deviation, which can be due to non-Gaussian tails in the primary beam and to forward scattering in the resist, must be taken into account for accurate proximity correction in most submicron lithography, and certainly on the sub-100 nm scale.},

By mapping their 3D surface charge distributions directly, we have demonstrated two different kinds of mirror-induced bonding dipole plasmon modes and confirmed the bonding hybridizations of the mirror and the NP-dimer which may offer a much stronger near-field enhancement than that of the isolated NP dimers over a broad wavelength range. Further, it is revealed that the huge near-field enhancement of these two modes exhibit different dependence on the NP-NP and NP-mirror hot spots, while both of their near-field resonance wavelengths can be tuned to the blue exponentially by increasing the NP-NP gaps or the NP-mirror separation. Our results here benifit significantly the fundamental understanding and practical applications of metallic NPs on a mirror in plasmonics.},

In the present paper, distance dependence of particle temperature in an optically heated gold nanoparticle pair is quantitatively investigated to explore the possibility of creating a plasmon ruler based on this effect. The two origins of the distance-dependence, i.e., electromagnetic coupling and thermal accumulative effect, are studied. For the particle temperature, a scaling behavior is found, and it suggests that the decay of particle temperature with the interparticle gap for different particle sizes follows a common exponential decay equation. This scaling behavior is qualitatively explained with a simple dipolar-coupling model combined with a point heat source interaction model. On the basis of this scaling behavior of absorption power, we further establish a plasmon ruler equation relating the particle temperature and the interparticle distance. Our findings can serve as an excellent guideline for designing and optimizing temperature-based plasmon rulers.},

   abstract = {Chiral metamaterials have shown a number of interesting properties which result from the interaction of the chiral near-field they produce with light and matter. We investigate the influence of structural imperfections on the plasmonic properties of a chiral gold "gammadion", using electron energy loss spectroscopy to directly inform simulations of realistic, imperfect structures. Unlike structures of simple convex geometry, the lowest energy modes of the ideal concave gammadion have a quadrupole and dipole character, with the mode energies determined by the nature of electrostatic coupling between the gammadion arms. These modes are strongly affected by structural imperfections that are inherent to the material properties and lithographic patterning. Even subwavelength-scale imperfections reduce the symmetry, lift mode degeneracies convert dark modes into bright ones and significantly alter the mode energy, its near-field strength, and chirality. Such effects will be common to a number of multitipped concave structures currently being investigated for the chiral fields they support.},

   abstract = {This paper develops a novel method for simultaneously determining the plasma frequency ωP and the damping constant γfree in the bulk damped oscillator Drude model, based on experimentally measured real and imaginary parts of the metal refractive index in the IR wavelength range, lifting the usual approximation that restricts frequency values to the UV-deep UV region. Our method was applied to gold, silver, and copper, improving the relative uncertainties in the final values for ωp (0.5%-1.6%) and for γfree (3%-8%), which are smaller than those reported in the literature. These small uncertainties in ωp and γfree determination yield a much better fit of the experimental complex dielectric function. For the case of nanoparticles (Nps), a series expansion of the Drude expression (which includes ωp and γfree determined using our method) enables size-dependent dielectric function to be written as the sum of three terms: the experimental bulk dielectric function plus two size corrective terms, one for free electron, and the other for bound-electron contributions. Finally, size distribution of nanometric and subnanometric gold Nps in colloidal suspension was determined through fitting its experimental optical extinction spectrum using Mie theory based on the previously determined dielectric function. Results are compared with size histogram obtained from Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).},

A Basin-hopping algorithm is used to fit the Drude-Lorentz model to the nonequilibrium permittivity calculated using ab initio methods. The fitting coefficients are provided and can be easily inserted into any calculation requiring the optical response of the metals during ultrafast irradiation. Moreover, our results shed light on the electronic structure modifications and the relative contributions of intraband and interband optical transitions at high electron temperatures corresponding to the laser excitation fluence used for surface nanostructuring.},

These collisions can be incorporated into a Monte-Carlo simulation model if all the cross sections associated with the various types of collisions are known. Elastic diffusion effects are mainly related to the interactions of the particles with the real potential V(r) surrounding each ionic core. An essential simplification of the inelastic interactions is to consider that the solid reacts as a whole to an external probe, which is the incident electron beam. The linear response of the solid to an external perturbation is described by its dielectric function. In the present paper, the methods used to evaluate the elastic and inelastic cross-sections and to simulate the secondary electron emission are reviewed and discussed.},

   abstract = {Previous work is extended so as to provide a determination of the shortest wavelength at which plasma oscillations can be sustained by a degenerate electron gas. The collective oscillations are treated without introducing collective coordinates, thereby avoiding possible complications associated with subsidiary conditions. Instead the Hartree self-consistent field method is used to provide a direct quantum-mechanical analog to the Bohm-Gross derivation of the dispersion relation. The effect of electron exchange, calculated by replacing the Hartree by the Hartree-Fock method, somewhat decreases the dependence of the plasma frequency on wave number. The maximum wave number corresponds to the momentum just sufficient to cause an electron at the surface of the Fermi sea to make a real transition, absorbing one plasma quantum of energy. This criterion agrees well with Watanabe's measurement of the maximum angle by which electrons undergoing the characteristic energy loss are scattered. The previous work on the intensity of the characteristic energy loss as a function of angle is supplemented by a study near cutoff, where is is shown that the intensity drops rapidly to zero as the maximum angle of scattering is approached. By use of the generalized sum rule of Nozières and Pines it is also possible to study the contribution of one-electron excitation to the differential stopping power. Varying as the fourth power of the angle of scattering, this contribution is negligible at small angles and first becomes dominant as the cutoff is approached. © 1957 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {Copper metal can provide an important alternative for the development of efficient, low-cost and low-loss plasmonic nanoparticles, and selective nanocatalysts. However, poor chemical stability and lack of insight into photophysics and plasmon decay mechanisms has impeded study. Here, we use smooth conformal ALD coating on copper nanoparticles to prevent surface oxidation, and study dephasing time for localized surface plasmons on different sized copper nanoparticles. Using dephasing time as a figure of merit, we elucidate the role of electron-electron, electron-phonon, impurity, surface and grain boundary scattering on the decay of localized surface plasmon waves. Using our quantitative analysis and different temperature dependent measurements, we show that electron-phonon interactions dominate over other scattering mechanisms in dephasing plasmon waves. While interband transitions in copper metal contributes substantially to plasmon losses, tuning surface plasmon modes to infrared frequencies leads to a five-fold enhancement in the quality factor. These findings demonstrate that conformal ALD coatings can improve the chemical stability for copper nanoparticles, even at high temperatures (>300 °C) in ambient atmosphere, and nanoscaled copper is a good alternative material for many potential applications in nanophotonics, plasmonics, catalysis and nanoscale electronics.},

   abstract = {The optical properties of W are presented between 0.15 and 33 eV. The optical absorptivity or reflectivity was measured at near-normal incidence, and the data were Kramers-Kronig analyzed to determine the dielectric functions. Drude parameters were determined at low energy and were used to separate interband and intraband contributions to 2. Structures in 2 were apparent at 0.42, 0.97, 1.82, 2.35, 3.42, 5.25, 8.8, 11.3, 16.5, 22.5, and 31.5 eV. These features were discussed in terms of recent calculations of Christensen and Feuerbacher and by analogy to other transtion metals studied. The loss functions were shown to have three volume plasmons (25.3, 15.2, and 10.0 eV) and three surface plasmons (20.8, 14.8, and 9.7 eV). Structure near 31.5 eV was interpreted as due to NVII core transitions. © 1975 The American Physical Society.},

From angle- and wavelength-dependent reflection measurements the dielectric function of TiN, and thus the optical constants, were calculated. Therefore, the main aim of this work was the determination of the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function ε(ω) and thus the dispersion relation of SP of TiN. This method is an alternative to the standard technique of ellipsometry for determination of the complex dielectric function. © 1994.},

Optical efficiencies are shown to be better indicators of performance as compared to approximations in the quasistatic regime. The near-field intensity efficiency, which is a generalized form of the wellknown scattering efficiency, is a more flexible and useful metric for local-field enhancement applications.We also examine the evolution of the field enhancement from a particle surface to the far-field regime for spherical nanoparticles with varying radii. Titanium nitride and zirconium nitride, which were recently suggested as alternative plasmonic materials in the visible and near-infrared ranges, are compared to the performance of gold. In contrast to the results from quasistatic methods, both nitride materials are very good alternatives to the usual plasmonic materials. © Springer-Verlag 2012.},

The films were fabricated through DC magnetron sputtering at various deposition temperature ranging from room temperature to 427 °C and annealed at different vacuum levels. Both the structural and optical properties are found to be critically dependent on deposition temperature and anneal conditions. Films deposited between 205 and 320 °C are shown to exhibit lower negative permittivity and better thermal stability, which could be linked to specific crystalline orientations. The films are stable when annealed at 10−8 Torr, but are partially oxidized when annealed at 10−6 Torr, suggesting oxidization could be a restricting issue for high-temperature applications in ambient environment.},

In contrast to similar alloys, such as films of Au3Zr, the films express more negative ε′ values and lower ε″ values across most of the wavelengths (370–1570 nm) investigated. The Au3Hf films were fabricated by DC magnetron sputtering at a range of deposition temperatures, from room temperature to 415 °C, and annealed at different vacuum levels. The films mostly formed as a combination of Au3Hf, Au2Hf and Au4Hf phases when deposited below 400 °C, and exclusively Au3Hf phase at above 400 °C, indicating key conditions for isolating this phase. The films were stable when annealed at 10−8 Torr, but when annealed again at 10−6 Torr the films oxidised and changed into a mix of Au-Hf phases, suggesting resistance to oxidization may be an issue for unencapsulated applications at elevated temperatures.},
